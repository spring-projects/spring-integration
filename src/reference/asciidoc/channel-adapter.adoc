=== Channel Adapter

A channel adapter is a message endpoint that enables connecting a single sender or receiver to a message channel.
Spring Integration provides a number of adapters to support various transports, such as JMS, file, HTTP, web services, mail, and more.
Upcoming chapters of this reference guide discuss each adapter.
However, this chapter focuses on the simple but flexible method-invoking channel adapter support.
There are both inbound and outbound adapters, and each may be configured with XML elements provided in the core namespace.
These provide an easy way to extend Spring Integration, as long as you have a method that can be invoked as either a source or a destination.

==== Configuring An Inbound Channel Adapter

An `inbound-channel-adapter` element (a `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` in Java configuration) can invoke any method on a Spring-managed object and send a non-null return value to a `MessageChannel` after converting the method's output to a `Message`.
When the adapter's subscription is activated, a poller tries to receive messages from the source.
The poller is scheduled with the `TaskScheduler` according to the provided configuration.
To configure the polling interval or cron expression for an individual channel adapter, you can provide a 'poller' element with one of the scheduling attributes, such as 'fixed-rate' or 'cron'.
The following example defines two `inbound-channel-adapter` instances:

====
[source, java, role="primary"]
.Java DSL
----
@Bean
public IntegrationFlow source1() {
    return IntegrationFlow.from(() -> new GenericMessage<>(...),
                             e -> e.poller(p -> p.fixedRate(5000)))
                ...
                .get();
}

@Bean
public IntegrationFlow source2() {
    return IntegrationFlow.from(() -> new GenericMessage<>(...),
                             e -> e.poller(p -> p.cron("30 * 9-17 * * MON-FRI")))
                ...
                .get();
}
----
[source, java, role="secondary"]
.Java
----
public class SourceService {

    @InboundChannelAdapter(channel = "channel1", poller = @Poller(fixedRate = "5000"))
    Object method1() {
        ...
    }

    @InboundChannelAdapter(channel = "channel2", poller = @Poller(cron = "30 * 9-17 * * MON-FRI"))
    Object method2() {
        ...
    }
}

fun messageSourceFlow() =
    integrationFlow( { GenericMessage<>(...) },
                    { poller { it.fixedRate(5000) } }) {
        ...
    }

[IMPORTANT]
.Important: Poller Configuration
=====
All the `inbound-channel-adapter` types are backed by a `SourcePollingChannelAdapter`, which means they contain a poller configuration that polls the `MessageSource` (to invoke a custom method that produces the value that becomes a `Message` payload) based on the configuration specified in the Poller.
The following example shows the configuration of two pollers:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" fixed-rate="1000"/>

<int:poller max-messages-per-poll="10" fixed-rate="1000"/>
----
====

In the first configuration, the polling task is invoked once per poll, and, during each task (poll), the method (which results in the production of the message) is invoked once, based on the `max-messages-per-poll` attribute value.
In the second configuration, the polling task is invoked 10 times per poll or until it returns 'null', thus possibly producing ten messages per poll while each poll happens at one-second intervals.
However, what happens if the configuration looks like the following example:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
----
====

Note that there is no `max-messages-per-poll` specified.
As we cover later, the identical poller configuration in the `PollingConsumer` (for example, `service-activator`, `filter`, `router`, and others) would have a default value of `-1` for `max-messages-per-poll`, which means "`execute the polling task non-stop unless the polling method returns null (perhaps because there are no more messages in the `QueueChannel`)`" and then sleep for one second.

However, in the `SourcePollingChannelAdapter`, it is a bit different.
The default value for `max-messages-per-poll` is `1`, unless you explicitly set it to a negative value (such as `-1`).
This makes sure that the poller can react to lifecycle events (such as start and stop) and prevents it from potentially spinning in an infinite loop if the implementation of the custom method of the `MessageSource` has a potential to never return null and happens to be non-interruptible.

However, if you are sure that your method can return null, and you need to poll for as many sources as available per each poll, you should explicitly set `max-messages-per-poll` to a negative value, as the following example shows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:poller max-messages-per-poll="-1" fixed-rate="1000"/>
----
====

Starting with version 5.5, a `0` value for `max-messages-per-poll` has a special meaning - skip the `MessageSource.receive()` call altogether, which may be considered as pausing for this inbound channel adapter until the `maxMessagesPerPoll` is changed to a non-zero value at a later time, e.g. via a Control Bus.

Starting with version 6.2, the `fixed-delay` and `fixed-rate` can be configured in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601#Durations[ISO 8601 Duration] format, e.g. `PT10S`, `P1D` etc.
In addition, an `initial-interval` of the underlying `PeriodicTrigger` is also exposed with similar value formats as `fixed-delay` and `fixed-rate`.

Also see <<./endpoint.adoc#global-default-poller,Global Default Poller>> for more information.

[[channel-adapter-namespace-outbound]]
==== Configuring An Outbound Channel Adapter

An `outbound-channel-adapter` element (a `@ServiceActivator` for Java configuration) can also connect a `MessageChannel` to any POJO consumer method that should be invoked with the payload of messages sent to that channel.
The following example shows how to define an outbound channel adapter:

====
[source, java, role="primary"]
.Java DSL
----
@Bean
public IntegrationFlow outboundChannelAdapterFlow(MyPojo myPojo) {
    return f -> f
             .handle(myPojo, "handle");
}
----
[source, java, role="secondary"]
.Java
----
public class MyPojo {

    @ServiceActivator(channel = "channel1")
    void handle(Object payload) {
        ...
    }

}
----
[source, kotlin, role="secondary"]
.Kotlin DSL
----
@Bean
fun outboundChannelAdapterFlow(myPojo: MyPojo) =
    integrationFlow {
        handle(myPojo, "handle")
    }
----
[source, xml, role="secondary"]
.XML
----
<int:outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel1" ref="target" method="handle"/>

<beans:bean id="target" class="org.MyPojo"/>
----
====

If the channel being adapted is a `PollableChannel`, you must provide a poller sub-element (the `@Poller` sub-annotation on the `@ServiceActivator`), as the following example shows:

====
[source, java, role="primary"]
.Java
----
public class MyPojo {

    @ServiceActivator(channel = "channel1", poller = @Poller(fixedRate = "3000"))
    void handle(Object payload) {
        ...
    }

}
----
[source, xml, role="secondary"]
.XML
----
<int:outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel2" ref="target" method="handle">
    <int:poller fixed-rate="3000" />
</int:outbound-channel-adapter>

<beans:bean id="target" class="org.MyPojo"/>
----
====

You should use a `ref` attribute if the POJO consumer implementation can be reused in other `<outbound-channel-adapter>` definitions.
However, if the consumer implementation is referenced by only a single definition of the `<outbound-channel-adapter>`, you can define it as an inner bean, as the following example shows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:outbound-channel-adapter channel="channel" method="handle">
    <beans:bean class="org.Foo"/>
</int:outbound-channel-adapter>
----
====

NOTE: Using both the `ref` attribute and an inner handler definition in the same `<outbound-channel-adapter>` configuration is not allowed, as it creates an ambiguous condition.
Such a configuration results in an exception being thrown.

Any channel adapter can be created without a `channel` reference, in which case it implicitly creates an instance of `DirectChannel`.
The created channel's name matches the `id` attribute of the `<inbound-channel-adapter>` or `<outbound-channel-adapter>` element.
Therefore, if `channel` is not provided, `id` is required.

[[channel-adapter-expressions-and-scripts]]
==== Channel Adapter Expressions and Scripts

Like many other Spring Integration components, the `<inbound-channel-adapter>` and `<outbound-channel-adapter>` also provide support for SpEL expression evaluation.
To use SpEL, provide the expression string in the 'expression' attribute instead of providing the 'ref' and 'method' attributes that are used for method-invocation on a bean.
When an expression is evaluated, it follows the same contract as method-invocation where: the expression for an `<inbound-channel-adapter>` generates a message any time the evaluation result is a non-null value, while the expression for an `<outbound-channel-adapter>` must be the equivalent of a void-returning method invocation.

Starting with Spring Integration 3.0, an `<int:inbound-channel-adapter/>` can also be configured with a SpEL `<expression/>` (or even with a `<script/>`) sub-element, for when more sophistication is required than can be achieved with the simple 'expression' attribute.
If you provide a script as a `Resource` by using the `location` attribute, you can also set `refresh-check-delay`, which allows the resource to be periodically refreshed.
If you want the script to be checked on each poll, you would need to coordinate this setting with the poller's trigger, as the following example shows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:inbound-channel-adapter ref="source1" method="method1" channel="channel1">
    <int:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" fixed-delay="5000"/>
    <script:script lang="ruby" location="Foo.rb" refresh-check-delay="5000"/>
</int:inbound-channel-adapter>
----
====

See also the `cacheSeconds` property on the `ReloadableResourceBundleExpressionSource` when using the `<expression/>` sub-element.
For more information regarding expressions, see <<./spel.adoc#spel,Spring Expression Language (SpEL)>>.
For scripts, see <<./groovy.adoc#groovy,Groovy support>> and <<./scripting.adoc#scripting,Scripting Support>>.

IMPORTANT: The `<int:inbound-channel-adapter/>` (`SourcePollingChannelAdapter`) is an endpoint which starts a message flow by periodically triggering to poll some underlying `MessageSource`.
Since, at the time of polling, there is no message object, expressions and scripts do not have access to a root `Message`, so there are no payload or headers properties that are available in most other messaging SpEL expressions.
The script can generate and return a complete `Message` object with headers and payload or only a payload, which is added to a message with basic headers by the framework.
