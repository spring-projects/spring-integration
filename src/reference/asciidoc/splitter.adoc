[[splitter]]
=== Splitter

The splitter is a component whose role is to partition a message into several parts and send the resulting messages to be processed independently.
Very often, they are upstream producers in a pipeline that includes an aggregator.

==== Programming Model

The API for performing splitting consists of one base class, `AbstractMessageSplitter`.
It is a `MessageHandler` implementation that encapsulates features common to splitters, such as filling in the appropriate message headers (`CORRELATION_ID`, `SEQUENCE_SIZE`, and `SEQUENCE_NUMBER`) on the messages that are produced.
This filling enables tracking down the messages and the results of their processing (in a typical scenario, these headers get copied to the messages that are produced by the various transforming endpoints).
The values can then be used, for example, by a https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/DistributionAggregate.html[composed message processor].

The following example shows an excerpt from `AbstractMessageSplitter`:

[source,java]
----
public abstract class AbstractMessageSplitter
    extends AbstractReplyProducingMessageConsumer {
    ...
    protected abstract Object splitMessage(Message<?> message);

}
----

To implement a specific splitter in an application, you can extend `AbstractMessageSplitter` and implement the `splitMessage` method, which contains logic for splitting the messages.
The return value can be one of the following:

* A `Collection` or an array of messages or an `Iterable` (or `Iterator`) that iterates over messages.
In this case, the messages are sent as messages (after the `CORRELATION_ID`, `SEQUENCE_SIZE` and `SEQUENCE_NUMBER` are populated).
Using this approach gives you more control -- for example, to populate custom message headers as part of the splitting process.

* A `Collection` or an array of non-message objects or an `Iterable` (or `Iterator`) that iterates over non-message objects.
It works like the prior case, except that each collection element is used as a message payload.
Using this approach lets you focus on the domain objects without having to consider the messaging system and produces code that is easier to test.

* a `Message` or non-message object (but not a collection or an array).
It works like the previous cases, except that a single message is sent out.

In Spring Integration, any POJO can implement the splitting algorithm, provided that it defines a method that accepts a single argument and has a return value.
In this case, the return value of the method is interpreted as described earlier.
The input argument might either be a `Message` or a simple POJO.
In the latter case, the splitter receives the payload of the incoming message.
We recommend this approach, because it decouples the code from the Spring Integration API and is typically easier to test.

===== Iterators

Starting with version 4.1, the `AbstractMessageSplitter` supports the `Iterator` type for the `value` to split.
Note, in the case of an `Iterator` (or `Iterable`), we don't have access to the number of underlying items and the `SEQUENCE_SIZE` header is set to `0`.
This means that the default `SequenceSizeReleaseStrategy` of an `<aggregator>` won't work and the group for the `CORRELATION_ID` from the `splitter` won't be released; it will remain as `incomplete`.
In this case you should use an appropriate custom `ReleaseStrategy` or rely on `send-partial-result-on-expiry` together with `group-timeout` or a `MessageGroupStoreReaper`.

Starting with version 5.0, the `AbstractMessageSplitter` provides `protected obtainSizeIfPossible()` methods to allow the determination of the size of the `Iterable` and `Iterator` objects if that is possible.
For example `XPathMessageSplitter` can determine the size of the underlying `NodeList` object.
And starting with version 5.0.9, this method also properly returns a size of the `com.fasterxml.jackson.core.TreeNode`.

An `Iterator` object is useful to avoid the need for building an entire collection in the memory before splitting.
For example, when underlying items are populated from some external system (e.g. DataBase or FTP `MGET`) using iterations or streams.

[[split-stream-and-flux]]
===== Stream and Flux

Starting with version 5.0, the `AbstractMessageSplitter` supports the Java `Stream` and Reactive Streams `Publisher` types for the `value` to split.
In this case, the target `Iterator` is built on their iteration functionality.

In addition, if the splitter's output channel is an instance of a `ReactiveStreamsSubscribableChannel`, the `AbstractMessageSplitter` produces a `Flux` result instead of an `Iterator`, and the output channel is subscribed to this `Flux` for back-pressure-based splitting on downstream flow demand.

Starting with version 5.2, the splitter supports a `discardChannel` option for sending those request messages for which a split function has returned an empty container (collection, array, stream, `Flux` etc.).
In this case there is just no item to iterate for sending to the `outputChannel`.
The `null` splitting result remains as an end of flow indicator.

==== Configuring a Splitter with Java, Groovy and Kotlin DSLs

An example of simple splitter based on a `Message` and its iterable payload with DSL configuration:

====
[source, java, role="primary"]
.Java DSL
----
@Bean
public IntegrationFlow someFlow() {
    return f -> f.split(Message.class, Message::getPayload);
}
----
[source, kotlin, role="secondary"]
.Kotlin DSL
----
@Bean
fun someFlow() =
    integrationFlow {
        split<Message<*>> { it.payload }
    }
----
[source, groovy, role="secondary"]
.Groovy DSL
----
@Bean
someFlow() {
    integrationFlow {
        splitWith {
		    expectedType Message<?>
		    function { it.payload }
        }
    }
}
----

* <<./kotlin-dsl.adoc#kotlin-dsl,Kotlin DSL>>
* <<./groovy-dsl.adoc#groovy-dsl,Groovy DSL>>

==== Configuring a Splitter with XML

A splitter can be configured through XML as follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:channel id="inputChannel"/>

<int:splitter id="splitter"           <1>
  ref="splitterBean"                  <2>
  method="split"                      <3>
  input-channel="inputChannel"        <4>
  output-channel="outputChannel"      <5>
  discard-channel="discardChannel" /> <6>

<int:channel id="outputChannel"/>

<beans:bean id="splitterBean" class="sample.PojoSplitter"/>
----
<1> The ID of the splitter is optional.
<2> A reference to a bean defined in the application context.
The bean must implement the splitting logic, as described in the earlier section.
Optional.
If a reference to a bean is not provided, it is assumed that the payload of the message that arrived on the `input-channel` is an implementation of `java.util.Collection` and the default splitting logic is applied to the collection, incorporating each individual element into a message and sending it to the `output-channel`.
<3> The method (defined on the bean) that implements the splitting logic.
Optional.
<4> The input channel of the splitter.
Required.
<5> The channel to which the splitter sends the results of splitting the incoming message.
Optional (because incoming messages can specify a reply channel themselves).
<6> The channel to which the request message is sent in case of empty splitting result.
Optional (they will stop as in case of `null` result).
====

We recommend using a `ref` attribute if the custom splitter implementation can be referenced in other `<splitter>` definitions.
However, if the custom splitter handler implementation should be scoped to a single definition of the `<splitter>`, you can configure an inner bean definition, as the following example follows:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:splitter id="testSplitter" input-channel="inChannel" method="split"
                output-channel="outChannel">
  <beans:bean class="org.foo.TestSplitter"/>
</int:splitter>
----
====

NOTE: Using both a `ref` attribute and an inner handler definition in the same `<int:splitter>` configuration is not allowed, as it creates an ambiguous condition and results in an exception being thrown.

IMPORTANT: If the `ref` attribute references a bean that extends `AbstractMessageProducingHandler` (such as splitters provided by the framework itself), the configuration is optimized by injecting the output channel into the handler directly.
In this case, each `ref` must be a separate bean instance (or a `prototype`-scoped bean) or use the inner `<bean/>` configuration type.
However, this optimization applies only if you do not provide any splitter-specific attributes in the splitter XML definition.
If you inadvertently reference the same message handler from multiple beans, you get a configuration exception.

==== Configuring a Splitter with Annotations

The `@Splitter` annotation is applicable to methods that expect either the `Message` type or the message payload type, and the return values of the method should be a `Collection` of any type.
If the returned values are not actual `Message` objects, each item is wrapped in a `Message` as the payload of the `Message`.
Each resulting `Message` is sent to the designated output channel for the endpoint on which the `@Splitter` is defined.

The following example shows how to configure a splitter by using the `@Splitter` annotation:

====
[source,java]
----
@Splitter
List<LineItem> extractItems(Order order) {
    return order.getItems()
}
----
