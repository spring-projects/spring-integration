[[migration-5.0-5.1]]
=== Changes between 5.0 and 5.1

[[x5.1-new-components]]
==== New Components

The following components are new in 5.1:

* <<x5.1-AmqpDedicatedChannelAdvice>>

[[x5.1-AmqpDedicatedChannelAdvice]]
===== `AmqpDedicatedChannelAdvice`

See <<./amqp.adoc#amqp-strict-ordering,Strict Message Ordering>>.

[[x5.1-Functions]]
===== Improved Function Support

The `java.util.function` interfaces now have improved integration support in the Framework components.
Also Kotlin lambdas now can be used for handler and source methods.

See <<./functions-support.adoc#functions-support,`java.util.function` Interfaces Support>>.

[[x5.1-LongRunningTest]]
===== `@LongRunningTest`

A JUnit 5 `@LongRunningTest` conditional annotation is provided to check the environment or system properties for the `RUN_LONG_INTEGRATION_TESTS` entry with the value of `true` to determine if test should be run or skipped.

See <<./testing.adoc#test-junit-rules,JUnit Rules and Conditions>>.

[[x5.1-general]]
==== General Changes

The following changes have been made in version 5.1:

* <<x5.1-java-dsl>>
* <<x5.1-dispatcher-exceptions>>
* <<x5.1-global-channel-interceptors>>
* <<x5.1-object-to-json-transformer>>
* <<x5.1-integration-flows-generated-bean-names>>
* <<x5.1-aggregator>>
* <<x5.1-publisher>>
* <<x51.-integration-graph>>
* <<x51.-global-properties>>
* <<x51.-poller-annotation>>

[[x5.1-java-dsl]]
===== Java DSL

The `IntegrationFlowContext` is now an interface and `IntegrationFlowRegistration` is an inner interface of `IntegrationFlowContext`.

A new `logAndReply()` operator has been introduced for convenience when you wish to log at the end of a flow for request-reply configurations.
This avoids confusion with `log()` which is treated as a one-way end flow component.

A generated bean name for any `NamedComponent` within an integration flow is now based on the component type for better readability from visual tools, logs analyzers and metrics collectors.

The `GenericHandler.handle()` now excepts a `MessageHeaders` type for the second argument.

[[x5.1-dispatcher-exceptions]]
===== Dispatcher Exceptions

Exceptions caught and re-thrown by `AbstractDispatcher` are now more consistent:

* A `MessagingException` of any kind that has a `failedMessage` property is re-thrown unchanged.
* All other exceptions are wrapped in a `MessageDeliveryException` with the `failedMessage` property set.

Previously:

* A `MessagingException` of any kind that has a `failedMessage` property was re-thrown unchanged
* A `MessagingException` that had no `failedMessage` property was wrapped in a `MessagingException` with the `failedMessage` property set.
* Other `RuntimeException` instances were re-thrown unchanged.
* Checked exceptions were wrapped in a `MessageDeliveryException` with the `failedMessage` property set.

[[x5.1-global-channel-interceptors]]
===== Global Channel Interceptors

Global channel interceptors now apply to dynamically registered channels, such as through the `IntegrationFlowContext` when using the Java DSL or beans that are initialized using `beanFactory.initializeBean()`.
Previously, when beans were created after the application context was refreshed, interceptors were not applied.

[[x5.1-channel-interceptors]]
===== Channel Interceptors

`ChannelInterceptor.postReceive()` is no longer called when no message is received; it is no longer necessary to check for a `null` `Message<?>`.
Previously, the method was called.
If you have an interceptor that relies on the previous behavior, implement `afterReceiveCompleted()` instead, since that method is invoked, regardless of whether a message is received or not.
Furthermore, the `PolledAmqpChannel` and `PolledJmsChannel` previously did not invoke `afterReceiveCompleted()` with `null`; they now do.

[[x5.1-object-to-json-transformer]]
===== `ObjectToJsonTransformer`

A new `ResultType.BYTES` mode is introduced for the `ObjectToJsonTransformer`.

See <<./transformer.adoc#json-transformers,JSON Transformers>> for more information.

[[x5.1-integration-flows-generated-bean-names]]
===== Integration Flows: Generated Bean Names

Starting with version 5.0.5, generated bean names for the components in an `IntegrationFlow` include the flow bean name, followed by a dot, as a prefix.
For example, if a flow bean were named `flowBean`, a generated bean might be named `flowBean.generatedBean`.

See <<./dsl.adoc#java-dsl-flows,Working With Message Flows>> for more information.

[[x5.1-aggregator]]
===== Aggregator Changes

If the `groupTimeout` is evaluated to a negative value, an aggregator now expires the group immediately.
Only `null` is considered as a signal to do nothing for the current message.

A new `popSequence` property has been introduced to allow (by default) to call a `MessageBuilder.popSequenceDetails()` for the output message.
Also an `AbstractAggregatingMessageGroupProcessor` returns now an `AbstractIntegrationMessageBuilder` instead of the whole `Message` for optimization.

See <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>> for more information.

[[x5.1-publisher]]
===== @Publisher annotation changes

Starting with version 5.1, you must explicitly turn on the `@Publisher` AOP functionality by using `@EnablePublisher` or by using the `<int:enable-publisher>` child element on `<int:annotation-config>`.
Also the `proxy-target-class` and `order` attributes have been added for tuning the `ProxyFactory` configuration.

See <<./message-publishing.adoc#publisher-annotation,Annotation-driven Configuration with the `@Publisher` Annotation>> for more information.

[[x5.1-files]]
==== Files Changes

If you are using `FileExistsMode.APPEND` or `FileExistsMode.APPEND_NO_FLUSH` you can provide a `newFileCallback` that will be called when creating a new file.
This callback receives the newly created file and the message that triggered the callback.
This could be used to write a CSV header, for an example.

The `FileReadingMessageSource` now doesn't check and create a directory until its `start()` is called.
So, if an Inbound Channel Adapter for the `FileReadingMessageSource` has `autoStartup = false`, there are no failures against the file system during application start up.

See <<./file.adoc#files,File Support>> for more information.

[[x5.1-amqp]]
==== AMQP Changes

We have made `ID` and `Timestamp` header mapping changes in the `DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper`.
See the note near the bottom of <<./amqp.adoc#amqp-message-headers,AMQP Message Headers>> for more information.

The `contentType` header is now correctly mapped as an entry in the general headers map.
See <<./amqp.adoc#amqp-content-type,contentType Header>> for more information.

Starting with version 5.1.3, if a message conversion exception occurs when using manual acknowledgments, and an error channel is defined, the payload is a `ManualAckListenerExecutionFailedException` with additional `channel` and `deliveryTag` properties.
This enables the error flow to ack/nack the original message.
See <<./amqp.adoc#amqp-conversion-inbound,Inbound Message Conversion>> for more information.

[[x5.1-jdbc]]
==== JDBC Changes

A confusing `max-rows-per-poll` property on the JDBC Inbound Channel Adapter and JDBC Outbound Gateway has been deprecated in favor of the newly introduced `max-rows` property.

The `JdbcMessageHandler` supports now a `batchUpdate` functionality when the payload of the request message is an instance of an `Iterable` type.

The indexes for the `INT_CHANNEL_MESSAGE` table (for the `JdbcChannelMessageStore`) have been optimized.
If you have large message groups in such a store, you may wish to alter the indexes.

See <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc,JDBC Support>> for more information.

[[x5.1-ftp-sftp]]
==== FTP and SFTP Changes

A `RotatingServerAdvice` is now available to poll multiple servers and directories with the inbound channel adapters.
See <<./ftp.adoc#ftp-rotating-server-advice,Inbound Channel Adapters: Polling Multiple Servers and Directories>> and <<./sftp.adoc#sftp-rotating-server-advice,Inbound Channel Adapters: Polling Multiple Servers and Directories>> for more information.

Also, inbound adapter `localFilenameExpression` instances can contain the `#remoteDirectory` variable, which contains the remote directory being polled.
The generic type of the comparators (used to sort the fetched file list for the streaming adapters) has changed from `Comparator<AbstractFileInfo<F>>` to `Comparator<F>`.
See <<./ftp.adoc#ftp-streaming,FTP Streaming Inbound Channel Adapter>> and <<./sftp.adoc#sftp-streaming,SFTP Streaming Inbound Channel Adapter>> for more information.

In addition, the synchronizers for inbound channel adapters can now be provided with a `Comparator`.
This is useful when using `maxFetchSize` to limit the files retrieved.

The `CachingSessionFactory` has a new property `testSession` which, when true, causes the factory to perform a `test()` operation on the `Session` when checking out an existing session from the cache.

See <<./sftp.adoc#sftp-session-caching,SFTP Session Caching>> and <<./ftp.adoc#ftp-session-caching,FTP Session Caching>> for more information.

The outbound gateway MPUT command now supports a message payload with a collection of files or strings.
See <<./sftp.adoc#sftp-outbound-gateway,SFTP Outbound Gateway>> and <<./ftp.adoc#ftp-outbound-gateway,FTP Outbound Gateway>> for more information.

[[x51.-tcp]]
==== TCP Support

When using SSL, host verification is now enabled, by default, to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks with a trusted certificate.
See <<./ip.adoc#tcp-ssl-host-verification,Host Verification>> for more information.

In addition the key and trust store types can now be configured on the `DefaultTcpSSLContextSupport`.

[[x5.1-twitter]]
==== Twitter Support

Since the Spring Social project has moved to https://spring.io/blog/2018/07/03/spring-social-end-of-life-announcement[end of life status], Twitter support in Spring Integration has been moved to the Extensions project.
See https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-extensions/tree/main/spring-integration-social-twitter[Spring Integration Social Twitter] for more information.

[[x51.-jms]]
==== JMS Support

The `JmsSendingMessageHandler` now provides `deliveryModeExpression` and `timeToLiveExpression` options to determine respective QoS options for JMS message to send at runtime.
The `DefaultJmsHeaderMapper` now allows to map inbound `JMSDeliveryMode` and `JMSExpiration` properties via setting to `true` respective `setMapInboundDeliveryMode()` and `setMapInboundExpiration()` options.
When a `JmsMessageDrivenEndpoint` or `JmsInboundGateway` is stopped, the associated listener container is now shut down; this closes its shared connection and any consumers.
You can configure the endpoints to revert to the previous behavior.

See <<./jms.adoc#jms,JMS Support>> for more information.

[[x51.-http]]
==== HTTP/WebFlux Support

The `statusCodeExpression` (and `Function`) is now supplied with the `RequestEntity<?>` as a root object for evaluation context, so request headers, method, URI and body are available for target status code calculation.

See <<./http.adoc#http,HTTP Support>> and <<./webflux.adoc#webflux,WebFlux Support>> for more information.

[[x51.-jmx]]
==== JMX Changes

Object name key values are now quoted if they contain any characters other than those allowed in a Java identifier (or period `.`).
For example `org.springframework.integration:type=MessageChannel,` `name="input:foo.myGroup.errors"`.
This has the side effect that previously "allowed" names, with such characters, will now be quoted.
For example `org.springframework.integration:type=MessageChannel,` `name="input#foo.myGroup.errors"`.

[[x51.-micrometer]]
==== Micrometer Support Changes

It is now simpler to customize the standard Micrometer meters created by the framework.
See <<./metrics.adoc#micrometer-integration,Micrometer Integration>> for more information.

[[x51.-integration-graph]]
==== Integration Graph Customization

It is now possible to add additional properties to the `IntegrationNode` s via `Function<NamedComponent, Map<String, Object>> additionalPropertiesCallback` on the `IntegrationGraphServer`.
See <<./graph.adoc#integration-graph,Integration Graph>> for more information.

[[x51.-global-properties]]
==== Integration Global Properties

The Integration global properties (including defaults) can now be printed in the logs, when a `DEBUG` logic level is turned on for the `org.springframework.integration` category.
See <<./configuration.adoc#global-properties,Global Properties>> for more information.

[[x51.-poller-annotation]]
==== The `receiveTimeout` for `@Poller`

The `@Poller` annotation now provides a `receiveTimeout` option for convenience.
See <<./configuration.adoc#configuration-using-poller-annotation,Using the `@Poller` Annotation>> for more information.
