=== Message Store

The https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/[_Enterprise Integration Patterns_] (EIP) book identifies several patterns that have the ability to buffer messages.
For example, an aggregator buffers messages until they can be released, and a `QueueChannel` buffers messages until consumers explicitly receive those messages from that channel.
Because of the failures that can occur at any point within your message flow, EIP components that buffer messages also introduce a point where messages could be lost.

To mitigate the risk of losing messages, EIP defines the https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/MessageStore.html[message store] pattern, which lets EIP components store messages, typically in some type of persistent store (such as an RDBMS).

Spring Integration provides support for the message store pattern by:

* Defining an `org.springframework.integration.store.MessageStore` strategy interface
* Providing several implementations of this interface
* Exposing a `message-store` attribute on all components that have the capability to buffer messages so that you can inject any instance that implements the `MessageStore` interface.

Details on how to configure a specific message store implementation and how to inject a `MessageStore` implementation into a specific buffering component are described throughout the manual (see the specific component, such as <<./channel.adoc#channel-configuration-queuechannel,QueueChannel>>, <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>>, <<./delayer.adoc#delayer,Delayer>>, and others).
The following pair of examples show how to add a reference to a message store for a `QueueChannel` and for an aggregator:

.QueueChannel
====
[source,xml]
----
<int:channel id="myQueueChannel">
    <int:queue message-store="refToMessageStore"/>
<int:channel>
----
====

.Aggregator
====
[source,xml]
----
<int:aggregator â€¦ message-store="refToMessageStore"/>
----
====

By default, messages are stored in-memory by using `o.s.i.store.SimpleMessageStore`, an implementation of `MessageStore`.
That might be fine for development or simple low-volume environments where the potential loss of non-persistent messages is not a concern.
However, the typical production application needs a more robust option, not only to mitigate the risk of message loss but also to avoid potential out-of-memory errors.
Therefore, we also provide `MessageStore` implementations for a variety of data-stores.
The following is a complete list of supported implementations:

* <<./hazelcast.adoc#hazelcast-message-store,Hazelcast Message Store>>: Uses a Hazelcast distributed cache to store messages
* <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-message-store,JDBC Message Store>>: Uses an RDBMS to store messages
* <<./redis.adoc#redis-message-store,Redis Message Store>>: Uses a Redis key/value datastore to store messages
* <<./mongodb.adoc#mongodb-message-store,MongoDB Message Store>>: Uses a MongoDB document store to store messages

[IMPORTANT]
=====
However, be aware of some limitations while using persistent implementations of the `MessageStore`.

The Message data (payload and headers) is serialized and deserialized by using different serialization strategies, depending on the implementation of the `MessageStore`.
For example, when using `JdbcMessageStore`, only `Serializable` data is persisted by default.
In this case, non-Serializable headers are removed before serialization occurs.
Also, be aware of the protocol-specific headers that are injected by transport adapters (such as FTP, HTTP, JMS, and others).
For example, `<http:inbound-channel-adapter/>` maps HTTP headers into message headers, and one of them is an `ArrayList` of non-serializable `org.springframework.http.MediaType` instances.
However, you can inject your own implementation of the `Serializer` and `Deserializer` strategy interfaces into some `MessageStore` implementations (such as `JdbcMessageStore`) to change the behavior of serialization and deserialization.

Pay special attention to the headers that represent certain types of data.
For example, if one of the headers contains an instance of some Spring bean, upon deserialization, you may end up with a different instance of that bean, which directly affects some of the implicit headers created by the framework (such as `REPLY_CHANNEL` or `ERROR_CHANNEL`).
Currently, they are not serializable, but, even if they were, the deserialized channel would not represent the expected instance.

Beginning with Spring Integration version 3.0, you can resolve this issue with a header enricher configured to replace these headers with a name after registering the channel with the `HeaderChannelRegistry`.

Also, consider what happens when you configure a message-flow as follows: gateway -> queue-channel (backed by a persistent Message Store) -> service-activator.
That gateway creates a temporary reply channel, which is lost by the time the service-activator's poller reads from the queue.
Again, you can use the header enricher to replace the headers with a `String` representation.

For more information, see <<./content-enrichment.adoc#header-enricher,Header Enricher>>.
=====

Spring Integration 4.0 introduced two new interfaces:

* `ChannelMessageStore`: To implement operations specific for `QueueChannel` instances
* `PriorityCapableChannelMessageStore`: To mark `MessageStore` implementations to be used for `PriorityChannel` instances and to provide priority order for persisted messages.

The real behavior depends on the implementation.
The framework provides the following implementations, which can be used as a persistent `MessageStore` for `QueueChannel` and `PriorityChannel`:

* <<./redis.adoc#redis-cms,Redis Channel Message Stores>>
* <<./mongodb.adoc#mongodb-priority-channel-message-store,MongoDB Channel Message Store>>
* <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-message-store-channels,Backing Message Channels>>

[[sms-caution]]
[WARNING]
.Caution about `SimpleMessageStore`
=====
Starting with version 4.1, the `SimpleMessageStore` no longer copies the message group when calling `getMessageGroup()`.
For large message groups, this was a significant performance problem.
4.0.1 introduced a boolean `copyOnGet` property that lets you control this behavior.
When used internally by the aggregator, this property was set to `false` to improve performance.
It is now `false` by default.

Users accessing the group store outside of components such as aggregators now get a direct reference to the group being used by the aggregator instead of a copy.
Manipulation of the group outside the aggregator may cause unpredictable results.

For this reason, you should either not perform such manipulation or set the `copyOnGet` property to `true`.
=====

[[message-group-factory]]
==== Using `MessageGroupFactory`

Starting with version 4.3, some `MessageGroupStore` implementations can be injected with a custom `MessageGroupFactory` strategy to create and customize the `MessageGroup` instances used by the `MessageGroupStore`.
This defaults to a `SimpleMessageGroupFactory`, which produces `SimpleMessageGroup` instances based on the `GroupType.HASH_SET` (`LinkedHashSet`) internal collection.
Other possible options are `SYNCHRONISED_SET` and `BLOCKING_QUEUE`, where the last one can be used to reinstate the previous `SimpleMessageGroup` behavior.
Also, the `PERSISTENT` option is available.
See the next section for more information.
Starting with version 5.0.1, the `LIST` option is also available for when the order and uniqueness of messages in the group does not matter.

[[lazy-load-message-group]]
==== Persistent `MessageGroupStore` and Lazy-load

Starting with version 4.3, all persistent `MessageGroupStore` instances retrieve `MessageGroup` instances and their `messages` from the store in the lazy-load manner.
In most cases, it is useful for the correlation `MessageHandler` instances (see <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>> and <<./resequencer.adoc#resequencer,Resequencer>>), when it would add overhead to load entire the `MessageGroup` from the store on each correlation operation.

You can use the `AbstractMessageGroupStore.setLazyLoadMessageGroups(false)` option to switch off the lazy-load behavior from the configuration.

Our performance tests for lazy-load on MongoDB `MessageStore` (<<./mongodb.adoc#mongodb-message-store,MongoDB Message Store>>) and `<aggregator>` (<<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>>) use a custom `release-strategy` similar to the following:

====
[source,xml]
----
<int:aggregator input-channel="inputChannel"
                output-channel="outputChannel"
                message-store="mongoStore"
                release-strategy-expression="size() == 1000"/>
----
====

It produces results similar to the following for 1000 simple messages:

====
[source]
----

ms     %     Task name
-----------------------------------------

36266  093%  Eager
...
----
====

However, starting with version 5.5, all the persistent `MessageGroupStore` implementations provide a `streamMessagesForGroup(Object groupId)` contract based on the target database streaming API.
This improves resources utilization when groups are very big in the store.
Internally in the framework this new API is used in the <<./delayer.adoc#delayer,Delayer>> (for example) when it reschedules persisted messages on startup.
A returned `Stream<Message<?>>` must be closed in the end of processing, e.g. via auto-close by the `try-with-resources`.
Whenever a `PersistentMessageGroup` is used, its `streamMessages()` delegates to the `MessageGroupStore.streamMessagesForGroup()`.

[[message-group-condition]]
==== Message Group Condition

Starting with version 5.5, the `MessageGroup` abstraction provides a `condition` string option.
The value of this option can be anything that could be parsed later on for any reason to make a decision for the group.
For example a `ReleaseStrategy` from a <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator-api, correlation message handler>> may consult this property from the group instead of iterating all the messages in the group.
The `MessageGroupStore` exposes a `setGroupCondition(Object groupId, String condition)` API.
For this purpose a `setGroupConditionSupplier(BiFunction<Message<?>, String, String>)` option has been added to the `AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler`.
This function is evaluated against each message after it has been added to the group as well as the existing condition of the group.
The implementation may decide to return a new value, the existing value, or reset the target condition to `null`.
The value for a `condition` can be a JSON, SpEL expression, number or anything what can be serialized as a string and parsed afterwards.
For example, the `FileMarkerReleaseStrategy` from the <<./file.adoc#file-aggregator, File Aggregator>> component, populates a condition into a group from the `FileHeaders.LINE_COUNT` header of the `FileSplitter.FileMarker.Mark.END` message and consults with it from its `canRelease()` comparing a group size with the value in this condition.
This way it doesn't iterate all the messages in group to find a `FileSplitter.FileMarker.Mark.END` message with the `FileHeaders.LINE_COUNT` header.
It also allows the end marker to arrive at the aggregator before all the other records; for example when processing a file in a multi-threaded environment.

In addition, for configuration convenience, a `GroupConditionProvider` contract has been introduced.
The `AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler` checks if the provided `ReleaseStrategy` implements this interface and extracts a `conditionSupplier` for group condition evaluation logic.
