[[whats-new]]

== What's New in Spring Integration 6.0?

If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 6.0 development process.

In general the project has been moved to Java 17 baseline and migrated from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

[[x6.0-new-components]]
=== New Components

A new MQTT `ClientManager` has been added to support a reusable MQTT connection across different channel adapters.
See <<./mqtt.adoc#mqtt-shared-client,Shared MQTT Client Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-graphql]]
=== GraphQL Support

The GraphQL support has been added.
See <<./graphql.adoc#graphql,GraphQL Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-smb]]
=== SMB Support

SMB support has been added from the Spring Integration Extensions project.
The Java DSL (see `org.springframework.integration.smb.dsl.Smb` factory) also has been added to this module.
An `SmbStreamingMessageSource` and `SmbOutboundGateway` implementation are introduced.
See <<./smb.adoc#smb,SMB Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-general]]
=== General Changes

The messaging annotations are now `@Repeatable` and the same type can be declared several times on the same service method.
The messaging annotations don't require a `poller` attribute as an array of `@Poller` anymore.

See <<./configuration.adoc#annotations,Annotation Support>> for more information.

For convenience, the XML and Java DSL for Scatter-Gather, based on the `RecipientListRouter`, now sets an `applySequence = true`, so the gatherer part can rely on the default correlation strategies.

See <<./scatter-gather.adoc#scatter-gather,Scatter-Gather>> for more information.

The `AggregatingMessageHandler` now does not split a `Collection<Message<?>>` result of the `MessageGroupProcessor` (unless it is a `SimpleMessageGroupProcessor`) on the output, but emits a single message containing this whole collection as a payload.

See <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>> for more information.

The `IntegrationFlows` factory is now marked as deprecated in favor of the fluent API available in the `IntegrationFlow` interface itself.
The factory class will be removed in the future releases.

See <<./dsl.adoc#java-dsl,Java DSL>> for more information.

The `org.springframework.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture` has been deprecated starting with Spring Framework `6.0`.
All Spring Integration async API has been migrated to the `CompletableFuture`.

See <<./gateway.adoc#gw-completable-future, CompletableFuture support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-http]]
=== HTTP Changes

The `#cookies` variable for expression evaluation context, exposed in the `HttpRequestHandlingEndpointSupport`, is now a `MultiValueMap` to carry all the values for cookies set by the client.
See <<./http.adoc#http,HTTP Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-rmi]]
=== RMI Removal

The `spring-integration-rmi` module has been removed altogether after being deprecated in previous versions.
There is no replacement: it is recommended to migrate to more secure network and application protocols, such as WebSockets, RSockets, gRPC or REST.

=== Apache Kafka Changes

When providing a `RetryTemplate` on the inbound gateway or message-driven channel adapter, if an `errorChannel` is also provided, an `ErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` is automatically configured.

In addition, the new `KafkaErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` is provided; this can be used with a `DefaultErrorHandler` to avoid issues with long aggregated retry delays causing partitions rebalances.

See <<./kafka.adoc#kafka,Spring for Apache Kafka Support>> for more information.

=== JDBC Changes

The `DefaultLockRepository` can now be supplied with a `PlatformTransactionManager` instead of relying on the primary bean from the application context.

See <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-lock-registry,JDBC Lock Registry>> for more information.

=== TCP/IP Changes

The `lookupHost` property of the `AbstractConnectionFactory` and `DatagramPacketMessageMapper` is now set to `false` by default to avoid delays in the environments where DNS is not configured.

See <<./ip.adoc#ip,TCP and UDP Support>> for more information.
