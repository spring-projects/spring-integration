== What's New in Spring Integration 5.5?

If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 5.5 development process.

[[x5.5-new-components]]
=== New Components

[[x5.5-file-aggregator]]
==== File Aggregator

A `FileSplitter.FileMaker`-based implementation of `CorrelationStrategy`, `ReleaseStrategy` and `MessageGroupProcessor` as a `FileAggregator` component was introduced.
See <<./file.adoc#file-aggregator, File Aggregator>> for more information.

[[x5.5-mqtt-v5]]
==== MQTT v5 Support

The `Mqttv5PahoMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` and `Mqttv5PahoMessageHandler` (including respective `MqttHeaderMapper`) were introduced to support MQTT v5 protocol communication.
See <<./mqtt.adoc#mqtt-v5, MQTT v5 Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-general]]
=== General Changes

All the persistent `MessageGroupStore` implementation provide a `streamMessagesForGroup(Object groupId)` contract based on the target database streaming API.
See <<./message-store.adoc#message-store,Message Store>> for more information.

The `integrationGlobalProperties` bean (if declared) must be now an instance of `org.springframework.integration.context.IntegrationProperties` instead of `java.util.Properties`, which support is deprecated for backward compatibility.
The `spring.integration.channels.error.requireSubscribers=true` global property is added to indicate that the global default `errorChannel` must be configured with the `requireSubscribers` option (or not).
The `spring.integration.channels.error.ignoreFailures=true` global property is added to indicate that the global default `errorChannel` must ignore (or not) dispatching errors and pass the message to the next handler.
See <<./configuration.adoc#global-properties,Global Properties>> for more information.

An `AbstractPollingEndpoint` (source polling channel adapter and polling consumer) treats `maxMessagesPerPoll == 0` as to skip calling the source.
It can be changed to different value later on, e.g. via a Control Bus.
See <<./endpoint.adoc#endpoint-pollingconsumer,Polling Consumer>> for more information.

The `ConsumerEndpointFactoryBean` now accept a `reactiveCustomizer` `Function` to any input channel as reactive stream source and use a `ReactiveStreamsConsumer` underneath.
This is covered as a `ConsumerEndpointSpec.reactive()` option in Java DSL and as a `@Reactive` nested annotation for the messaging annotations.
See <<./reactive-streams.adoc#reactive-streams,Reactive Streams Support>> for more information.

The `groupTimeoutExpression` for a correlation message handler (an `Aggregator` and `Resequencer`) can now be evaluated to a `java.util.Date` for some fine-grained scheduling use-cases.
Also the `BiFunction groupConditionSupplier` option is added to the `AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler` to supply a `MessageGroup` condition against a message to be added to the group.
See <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>> for more information.

The `MessageGroup` abstraction can be supplied with a `condition` to evaluate later on to make a decision for the group.
See <<./message-store.adoc#message-group-condition,Message Group Condition>> for more information.

[[x5.5-integration-flows-composition]]
==== Integration Flows Composition

The new `IntegrationFlows.from(IntegrationFlow)` factory method has been added to allow starting the current `IntegrationFlow` from the output of an existing flow.
In addition, the `IntegrationFlowDefinition` has added a `to(IntegrationFlow)` terminal operator to continue the current flow at the input channel of some other flow.
See <<./dsl.adoc#integration-flows-composition,Integration Flows Composition>> for more information.

[[x5.5-amqp]]
==== AMQP Changes

The `AmqpInboundChannelAdapter` and `AmqpInboundGateway` (and the respective Java DSL builders) now support an `org.springframework.amqp.rabbit.retry.MessageRecoverer` as an AMQP-specific alternative to the general purpose `RecoveryCallback`.
See <<./amqp.adoc#amqp,AMQP Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-redis]]
==== Redis Changes

The `ReactiveRedisStreamMessageProducer` has now setters for all the `StreamReceiver.StreamReceiverOptionsBuilder` options, including an `onErrorResume` function.
See <<./redis.adoc#redis,Redis Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-http]]
==== HTTP Changes

The `HttpRequestExecutingMessageHandler` doesn't fallback to the `application/x-java-serialized-object` content type any more and lets the `RestTemplate` make the final decision for the request body conversion based on the `HttpMessageConverter` provided.
It also has now an `extractResponseBody` flag (which is `true` by default) to return just the response body, or to return the whole `ResponseEntity` as the reply message payload, independently of the provided `expectedResponseType`.
Same option is presented for the `WebFluxRequestExecutingMessageHandler`, too.
See <<./http.adoc#http,HTTP Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-file]]
==== File/FTP/SFTP Changes

The persistent file list filters now have a boolean property `forRecursion`.
Setting this property to `true`, also sets `alwaysAcceptDirectories`, which means that the recursive operation on the outbound gateways (`ls` and `mget`) will now always traverse the full directory tree each time.
This is to solve a problem where changes deep in the directory tree were not detected.
In addition, `forRecursion=true` causes the full path to files to be used as the metadata store keys; this solves a problem where the filter did not work properly if a file with the same name appears multiple times in different directories.
IMPORTANT: This means that existing keys in a persistent metadata store will not be found for files beneath the top level directory.
For this reason, the property is `false` by default; this may change in a future release.

The `FileInboundChannelAdapterSpec` has now a convenient `recursive(boolean)` option instead of requiring an explicit reference to the `RecursiveDirectoryScanner`.

[[x5.5-mongodb]]
==== MongoDb Changes

The `MongoDbMessageSourceSpec` was added into MongoDd Java DSL.
An `update` option is now exposed on both the `MongoDbMessageSource` and `ReactiveMongoDbMessageSource` implementations.

See <<./mongodb.adoc#mongodb,MongoDb Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-websocket]]
==== WebSockets Changes

The WebSocket channel adapters based on `ServerWebSocketContainer` can now be registered and removed at runtime.

See <<./web-sockets.adoc#web-sockets,WebSockets Support>> for more information.

[[x5.5-jpa]]
==== JPA Changes

The `JpaOutboundGateway` now supports an `Iterable` message payload for a `PersistMode.DELETE`.

See <<./jpa.adoc#jpa-outbound-channel-adapter,Outbound Channel Adapter>> for more information.

[[x55-gw]]
==== Gateway Changes

Previously, when using XML configuration, `@Gateway.payloadExpression` was ignored for no-argument methods.
There is one possible breaking change - if the method is annotated with `@Payload` as well as `@Gateway` (with a different expression) previously, the `@Payload` would be applied, now the `@Gateway.payloadExpression` is applied.
See <<./gateway.adoc#gateway-configuration-annotations,Gateway Configuration with Annotations and XML>> and <<./gateway.adoc#gateway-calling-no-argument-methods,Invoking No-Argument Methods>> for more information.
