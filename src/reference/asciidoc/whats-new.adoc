[[whats-new]]

== What's New in Spring Integration 6.0?

If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 6.0 development process.

In general the project has been moved to Java 17 baseline and migrated from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

[[x6.0-new-components]]
=== New Components

A Groovy DSL implementation for integration flow definitions has been added.
See <<./groovy-dsl.adoc#groovy-dsl,Groovy DSL>>  for more information.

[[x6.0-mqtt]]
==== MQTT ClientManager

A new MQTT `ClientManager` has been added to support a reusable MQTT connection across different channel adapters.
See <<./mqtt.adoc#mqtt-shared-client,Shared MQTT Client Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-graphql]]
==== GraphQL Support

The GraphQL support has been added.
See <<./graphql.adoc#graphql,GraphQL Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-camel]]
==== Apache Camel Support

Support for Apache Camel routes has been introduced.
See <<./camel.adoc#camel,Apache Camel Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-hazelcast]]
==== Hazelcast Support

The Hazelcast Spring Integration Extensions project has been migrated as the `spring-integration-hazelcast` module.
See <<./hazelcast.adoc#hazelcast,Hazelcast Support>>  for more information.

[[x6.0-smb]]
==== SMB Support

SMB support has been added from the Spring Integration Extensions project.
The Java DSL (see `org.springframework.integration.smb.dsl.Smb` factory) also has been added to this module.
An `SmbStreamingMessageSource` and `SmbOutboundGateway` implementation are introduced.
See <<./smb.adoc#smb,SMB Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-jdbc]]
==== PostgreSQL Push Notification

A `PostgresSubscribableChannel` allows to receive push notifications via `PostgresChannelMessageTableSubscriber` upon new messages add to the `JdbcChannelMessageStore`.

See <<./jdbc.adoc#postgresql-push,PostgreSQL: Receiving Push Notifications>> for more information.

[[x6.0-rmq]]
==== RabbitMQ Stream Queue Support

The AMQP module has been enhanced to provide support for inbound and outbound channel adapters using RabbitMQ Stream Queues.
See <<./amqp.adoc#rmq-streams,RabbitMQ Stream Queue Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-sftp]]
==== Apache MINA SFTP

The SFTP modules has been fully reworked from outdated JCraft JSch library to more robust and modern `org.apache.sshd:sshd-sftp` module of the Apache MINA project.

See <<./sftp.adoc#sftp,SFTP Adapters>> for more information.

[[x6.0-micrometer-observation]]
==== Micrometer Observation

Enabling observation for timers and tracing using Micrometer is now supported.
See <<./metrics.adoc#micrometer-observation,Micrometer Observation>> for more information.

[[x6.0-graalmv-polyglot]]
==== GraalVM Polyglot Support

The Scripting module now provides a `PolyglotScriptExecutor` implementation based on the GraalVM Polyglot support.
JavaScript support is now based on this executor since its JSR223 implementation has been removed from Java by itself.
See <<./scripting.adoc#scripting,Scripting Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-cassandra]]
==== Apache Cassandra Support

The Apache Cassandra Spring Integration Extensions project has been migrated as the `spring-integration-cassandra` module.
See <<./cassandra.adoc#cassandra,Apache Cassandra Support>> for more information.

[[x6.0-kotlin-coroutines]]
==== Kotlin Coroutines

Kotlin Coroutines support has been introduced to the framework.

See <<./kotlin-functions.adoc#kotlin-coroutines,Kotlin Coroutines>> for more information.

[[x6.0-general]]
=== General Changes

The messaging annotations are now `@Repeatable` and the same type can be declared several times on the same service method.
The messaging annotations don't require a `poller` attribute as an array of `@Poller` anymore.

See <<./configuration.adoc#annotations,Annotation Support>> for more information.

For convenience, the XML and Java DSL for Scatter-Gather, based on the `RecipientListRouter`, now sets an `applySequence = true`, so the gatherer part can rely on the default correlation strategies.

See <<./scatter-gather.adoc#scatter-gather,Scatter-Gather>> for more information.

Another convenient behavior change has been made to the `AbstractMappingMessageRouter`.
Now, setting a `defaultOutputChannel` also resets the `channelKeyFallback` property to `false`, so no attempts will be made to resolve a channel from its key, but the logic immediately falls back to sending the message to the `defaultOutputChannel`.

See <<./router.adoc#router-common-parameters-all,Router Options>> for more information.

The `AggregatingMessageHandler` now does not split a `Collection<Message<?>>` result of the `MessageGroupProcessor` (unless it is a `SimpleMessageGroupProcessor`) on the output, but emits a single message containing this whole collection as a payload.

See <<./aggregator.adoc#aggregator,Aggregator>> for more information.

The `IntegrationFlows` factory is now marked as deprecated in favor of the fluent API available in the `IntegrationFlow` interface itself.
The factory class will be removed in the future releases.

See <<./dsl.adoc#java-dsl,Java DSL>> for more information.

The `org.springframework.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture` has been deprecated starting with Spring Framework `6.0`.
All Spring Integration async API has been migrated to the `CompletableFuture`.

The Messaging Gateway interface method can now return `Future<Void>` and `Mono<Void>` with a proper asynchronous execution of the downstream flow.

Alongside with a `@MessagingGateway` annotation the interface can also be marked with a `@Primary`.

`@MessagingGateway` interfaces can now be use as an `@Import` resources for configuration.

The default naming strategy for gateway proxy beans can be customized via `@IntegrationComponentScan.nameGenerator()` attribute.
If `AnnotationConfigUtils.CONFIGURATION_BEAN_NAME_GENERATOR` bean is present, it is consulted otherwise before falling back to the `AnnotationBeanNameGenerator`.

See <<./gateway.adoc#gateway, Messaging Gateway>> for more information.

The `integrationGlobalProperties` bean is now declared by the framework as an instance of `org.springframework.integration.context.IntegrationProperties` instead of the previously deprecated `java.util.Properties`.

Message handlers which produce a collection as a reply (e.g. `JpaOutboundGateway`, `JdbcOutboundGateway` and other DB-based gateways) now return an empty result list if no records are returned by the query.
Previously, `null` was returned ending the flow, or throwing an exception, depending on `requiresReply`.

[[x6.0-rmi]]
=== RMI Removal

The `spring-integration-rmi` module has been removed altogether after being deprecated in previous versions.
There is no replacement: it is recommended to migrate to more secure network and application protocols, such as WebSockets, RSockets, gRPC or REST.

[[x6.0-gemfire]]
=== GemFire Removal

The `spring-integration-gemfire` module has been removed altogether since there is no Spring Data `2022.0.0` support for VMware GemFire or Apache Geode.

[[x6.0-http]]
=== HTTP Changes

The `#cookies` variable for expression evaluation context, exposed in the `HttpRequestHandlingEndpointSupport`, is now a `MultiValueMap` to carry all the values for cookies set by the client.
See <<./http.adoc#http,HTTP Support>> for more information.

=== Apache Kafka Changes

When providing a `RetryTemplate` on the inbound gateway or message-driven channel adapter, if an `errorChannel` is also provided, an `ErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` is automatically configured.

In addition, the new `KafkaErrorMessageSendingRecoverer` is provided; this can be used with a `DefaultErrorHandler` to avoid issues with long aggregated retry delays causing partitions rebalances.

See <<./kafka.adoc#kafka,Spring for Apache Kafka Support>> for more information.

=== JDBC Changes

The `DefaultLockRepository` can now be supplied with a `PlatformTransactionManager` instead of relying on the primary bean from the application context.

See <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-lock-registry,JDBC Lock Registry>> for more information.

=== TCP/IP Changes

The `lookupHost` property of the `AbstractConnectionFactory` and `DatagramPacketMessageMapper` is now set to `false` by default to avoid delays in the environments where DNS is not configured.

See <<./ip.adoc#ip,TCP and UDP Support>> for more information.

=== JMS Changes

The `JmsOutboundGateway` now creates a `TemporaryTopic` instead of `TemporaryQueue` if `replyPubSubDomain` option is set to `true`.

See <<./jms.adoc#jms,JMS Support>> for more information.

=== Security Changes

The `ChannelSecurityInterceptor` and its annotation `@SecuredChannel` and XML `<secured-channels>` configurations have been deprecated in favor of `AuthorizationChannelInterceptor`.

See <<./security.adoc#security,Security Support>> for more information.
