[[whats-new]]

== What's New in Spring Integration 6.1?

If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 6.1 development process.

In general the project has been moved to the latest dependency versions.

[[x6.1-new-components]]
=== New Components

[[x6.1-zip]]
==== Zip Support

The Zip Spring Integration Extension project has been migrated as the `spring-integration-zip` module.
See <<./zip.adoc#zip,Zip Support>>  for more information.

[[x6.1-context-holder-advice]]
==== `ContextHolderRequestHandlerAdvice`

The `ContextHolderRequestHandlerAdvice` allows to store a value from a request message into some context around `MessageHandler` execution.
See <<./handler-advice.adoc#context-holder-advice, Context Holder Advice>> for more information.

[[x6.1-handle-reactive]]
==== The `handleReactive()` operator for Java DSL
The `IntegrationFlow` can now end with a convenient `handleReactive(ReactiveMessageHandler)` operator.
See <<./reactive-streams.adoc#reactive-message-handler, `ReactiveMessageHandler`>> for more information.

[[x6.1-general]]
=== General Changes

 - Added support for transforming to/from Protocol Buffers.
 See <<./transformer.adoc#Protobuf-transformers, Protocol Buffers Transformers>> for more information.

 - The `MessageFilter` now emits a warning into logs when message is silently discarded and dropped.
See <<./filter.adoc#filter, Filter>> for more information.

 - The default timeout for send and receive operations in gateways and replying channel adapters has been changed from infinity to `30` seconds.
Only one left as a `1` second is a `receiveTimeout` for `PollingConsumer` to not block a scheduler thread too long and let other queued tasks to be performed with the `TaskScheduler`.

 - The `IntegrationComponentSpec.get()` method has been deprecated with removal planned for the next version.
Since `IntegrationComponentSpec` is a `FactoryBean`, its bean definition must stay as is without any target object resolutions.
The Java DSL and the framework by itself will manage the `IntegrationComponentSpec` lifecycle.
See <<./dsl.adoc#java-dsl, Java DSL>> for more information.

 - The `AbstractMessageProducingHandler` is marked as an `async` by default if its output channel is configured to a `ReactiveStreamsSubscribableChannel`.
See <<./service-activator.adoc#async-service-activator,Asynchronous Service Activator>> for more information.

[[x6.1-web-sockets]]
=== Web Sockets Changes

A `ClientWebSocketContainer` can now be configured with a predefined `URI` instead of a combination of `uriTemplate` and `uriVariables`.
See <<./web-sockets.adoc#web-socket-overview, WebSocket Overview>> for more information.

[[x6.1-jms]]
=== JMS Changes

The `JmsInboundGateway`, via its `ChannelPublishingJmsMessageListener`, can now be configured with a `replyToExpression` to resolve a reply destination against the request message at runtime.
See <<./jms.adoc#jms-inbound-gateway, JMS Inbound Gateway>> for more information.

[[x6.1-mail]]
=== Mail Changes

The (previously deprecated) `ImapIdleChannelAdapter.sendingTaskExecutor` property has been removed in favor of an asynchronous message process downstream in the flow.
See <<./mail.adoc#mail-inbound, Mail-receiving Channel Adapter>> for more information.

[[x6.1-file]]
=== Files Changes

The `FileReadingMessageSource` now exposes `watchMaxDepth` and `watchDirPredicate` options for the `WatchService`.
See <<./file.adoc#watch-service-directory-scanner, `WatchServiceDirectoryScanner`>> for more information.

[[x6.1-amqp]]
=== AMQP Changes

The Java DSL API for Rabbit Streams (the `RabbitStream` factory) exposes additional properties for simple configurations.
See <<./amqp.adoc#rmq-streams, `RabbitMQ Stream Queue Support`>> for more information.


[[x6.1-jdbc]]
=== JDBC Changes

The `DefaultLockRepository` now exposes setters for `insert`, `update` and `renew` queries.
See <<./jdbc.adoc#jdbc-lock-registry, JDBC Lock Registry>> for more information.
