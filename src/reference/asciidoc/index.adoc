= Overview of Spring Integration Framework

[[spring-integration-intro]]
Spring Integration provides an extension of the Spring programming model to support the well-known http://www.eaipatterns.com/[Enterprise Integration Patterns].
It enables lightweight messaging _within_ Spring-based applications and supports integration with external systems via declarative adapters.
Those adapters provide a higher-level of abstraction over Spring's support for remoting, messaging, and scheduling.
Spring Integration's primary goal is to provide a simple model for building enterprise integration solutions while maintaining the separation of concerns that is essential for producing maintainable, testable code.
