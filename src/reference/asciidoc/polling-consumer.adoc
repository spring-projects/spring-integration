=== Poller

==== Polling Consumer

When Message Endpoints (Channel Adapters) are connected to channels and instantiated, they produce one of the following 2 instances:

* http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer]
* http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/EventDrivenConsumer.html[EventDrivenConsumer]



The actual implementation depends on which type of channel these Endpoints are connected to.
A channel adapter connected to a channel that implements the http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/messaging/SubscribableChannel.html[org.springframework.messaging.SubscribableChannel] interface will produce an instance of `EventDrivenConsumer`.
On the other hand, a channel adapter connected to a channel that implements the  http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/index.html?org/springframework/messaging/PollableChannel.html[org.springframework.messaging.PollableChannel] interface (e.g. a QueueChannel) will produce an instance of `PollingConsumer`.

Polling Consumers allow Spring Integration components to actively poll for Messages, rather than to process Messages in an event-driven manner.

They represent a critical cross cutting concern in many messaging scenarios.
In Spring Integration, Polling Consumers are based on the pattern with the same name, which is described in the book "Enterprise Integration Patterns" by Gregor Hohpe and Bobby Woolf.
You can find a description of the pattern on the book's website at:

http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PollingConsumer.html[http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/PollingConsumer.html]

[[pollable-message-source]]
==== Pollable Message Source

Furthermore, in Spring Integration a second variation of the Polling Consumer pattern exists.
When Inbound Channel Adapters are being used, these adapters are often wrapped by a `SourcePollingChannelAdapter`.
For example, when retrieving messages from a remote FTP Server location, the adapter described in <<ftp-inbound>> is configured with a _poller_ to retrieve messages periodically.
So, when components are configured with Pollers, the resulting instances are of one of the following types:

* http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/PollingConsumer.html[PollingConsumer]
* http://static.springsource.org/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/endpoint/SourcePollingChannelAdapter.html[SourcePollingChannelAdapter]



This means, Pollers are used in both inbound and outbound messaging scenarios.
Here are some use-cases that illustrate the scenarios in which Pollers are used:

* Polling certain external systems such as FTP Servers, Databases, Web Services
* Polling internal (pollable) Message Channels
* Polling internal services (E.g.
repeatedly execute methods on a Java class)



NOTE: AOP Advice classes can be applied to pollers, in an `advice-chain`.
An example being a transaction advice to start a transaction.
Starting with _version 4.1_ a `PollSkipAdvice` is provided.
Pollers use triggers to determine the time of the next poll.
The `PollSkipAdvice` can be used to suppress (skip) a poll, perhaps because there is some downstream condition that would prevent the message to be processed properly.
To use this advice, you have to provide it with an implementation of a `PollSkipStrategy`.
Starting with _version 4.2.5_, a `SimplePollSkipStrategy` is provided.
Add an instance as a bean to the application context, inject it into a `PollSkipAdvice` and add that to the poller's
advice chain.
To skip polling, call `skipPolls()`, to resume polling, call `reset()`.
_Version 4.2_ added more flexibility in this area - see <<conditional-pollers>>.

This chapter is meant to only give a high-level overview regarding Polling Consumers and how they fit into the concept of message channels - <<channel>> and channel adapters - <<channel-adapter>>.

[[deferred-acks-message-source]]
==== Deferred Acknowledgment Pollable Message Source

Starting with _version 5.0.1_, certain modules provide `MessageSource` implementations that support deferring acknowledgment until the downstream flow completes (or hands off the message to another thread).
This is currently limited to the `AmqpMessageSource` and the `KafkaMessageSource` provided by the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration-kafka[spring-kafka-integration extension project, version 3.0.1 or higher].

With these message sources, the `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.ACKNOWLEDGMENT_CALLBACK` header (see <<message-header-accessor>>) is added to the message.
The value of the header is an instance of `AcknowledgmentCallback`:

[source, java]
----
@FunctionalInterface
public interface AcknowledgmentCallback {

    void acknlowledge(Status status);

    boolean isAcknowledged();

    void noAutoAck();

    default boolean isAutoAck();

    enum Status {

        /**
         * Mark the message as accepted.
         */
        ACCEPT,

        /**
         * Mark the message as rejected.
         */
        REJECT,

        /**
         * Reject the message and requeue so that it will be redelivered.
         */
        REQUEUE

    }

}
----

Not all message sources (e.g. Kafka) support the `REJECT` status; it is treated the same as `ACCEPT`.

Applications can acknowledge a message at any time:

[source, java]
----
Message<?> received = source.receive();

...

StaticMessageHeaderAccessor.getAcknowledgmentCallback(received)
        .acknowledge(Status.ACCEPT);
----

If the `MessageSource` is wired into a `SourcePollingChannelAdapter`, when the poller thread returns to the adapter after the downstream flow completes, the adapter will check if the acknowledgment has already been acknowledged and, if not, `ACCEPT` it (or `REJECT` it if the flow throws an exception).

To perform ad-hoc polling of a `MessageSource` a `MessageSourcePollingTemplate` is provided; this, too will take care of `ACCEPT` ing or `REJECT` ing the `AcknowledgmentCallback` when the `MessageHandler` callback returns (or throws an exception).

[source, java]
----
MessageSourcePollingTemplate template =
    new MessageSourcePollingTemplate(this.source);
template.poll(h -> {
    ...
});
----

In both cases (`SourcePollingChannelAdapter` and `MessageSourcePollingTemplate`), you can disable auto ack/nack by calling `noAutoAck()` on the callback.
You might do this if you hand off the message to another thread and wish to acknowledge later.
Not all implementations support this (for example Apache Kafka because the offset commit has to be performed on the same thread).


[[conditional-pollers]]
==== Conditional Pollers for Message Sources

===== Background

`Advice` objects, in an `advice-chain` on a poller, advise the whole polling task (message retrieval and processing).
These "around advice" methods do not have access to any context for the poll, just the poll itself.
This is fine for requirements such as making a task transactional, or skipping a poll due to some external condition as discussed above.
What if we wish to take some action depending on the result of the `receive` part of the poll, or if we want to adjust the poller depending on conditions?

===== "Smart" Polling

_Version 4.2_ introduced the `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice`.
Any `Advice` objects in the `advice-chain` that subclass this class, are applied to just the receive operation.
Such classes implement the following methods:

[source, java]
beforeReceive(MessageSource<?> source)

This method is called before the `MessageSource.receive()` method.
It enables you to examine and or reconfigure the source at this time. Returning `false` cancels this poll (similar to the `PollSkipAdvice` mentioned above).

[source, java]
Message<?> afterReceive(Message<?> result, MessageSource<?> source)

This method is called after the `receive()` method; again, you can reconfigure the source, or take any action perhaps depending on the result (which can be `null` if there was no message created by the source).
You can even return a different message!

.Advice Chain Ordering
[IMPORTANT]
=====
It is important to understand how the advice chain is processed during initialization.
`Advice` objects that do not extend `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice` are applied to the whole poll process and are all invoked first, in order, before any `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice`; then `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice` objects are invoked in order around the `MessageSource` `receive()` method.
If you have, say `Advice` objects `a, b, c, d`, where `b` and `d` are `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice`, they will be applied in the order `a, c, b, d`.
Also, if a `MessageSource` is already a `Proxy`, the `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice` will be invoked after any existing `Advice` objects.
If you wish to change the order, you should wire up the proxy yourself.
=====

===== SimpleActiveIdleMessageSourceAdvice

This advice is a simple implementation of `AbstractMessageSourceAdvice`, when used in conjunction with a `DynamicPeriodicTrigger`, it adjusts the polling frequency depending on whether or not the previous poll resulted in a message or not.
The poller must also have a reference to the same `DynamicPeriodicTrigger`.

.Important: Async Handoff
IMPORTANT: This advice modifies the trigger based on the `receive()` result.
This will only work if the advice is called on the poller thread.
It will *not* work if the poller has a `task-executor`.
To use this advice where you wish to use async operations after the result of a poll, do the async handoff later, perhaps by using an `ExecutorChannel`.

===== CompoundTriggerAdvice

This advice allows the selection of one of two triggers based on whether a poll returns a message or not.
Consider a poller that uses a `CronTrigger`; `CronTrigger` s are immutable so cannot be altered once constructed.
Consider a use case where we want to use a cron expression to trigger a poll once each hour but, if no message is
received, poll once per minute and, when a message is retrieved, revert to using the cron expression.

The advice (and poller) use a `CompoundTrigger` for this purpose.
The trigger's `primary` trigger can be a `CronTrigger`.
When the advice detects that no message is received, it adds the secondary trigger to the `CompoundTrigger`.
When the `CompoundTrigger` 's `nextExecutionTime` method is invoked, it will delegate to the secondary trigger, if
present; otherwise the primary trigger.

The poller must also have a reference to the same `CompoundTrigger`.

The following shows the configuration for the hourly cron expression with fall-back to every minute...

</bean>

<bean id="secondary" class="org.springframework.scheduling.support.PeriodicTrigger">
    <constructor-arg value="60000" />
</bean>

.Important: Async Handoff
IMPORTANT: This advice modifies the trigger based on the `receive()` result.
This will only work if the advice is called on the poller thread.
It will *not* work if the poller has a `task-executor`.
To use this advice where you wish to use async operations after the result of a poll, do the async handoff later, perhaps by using an `ExecutorChannel`.
