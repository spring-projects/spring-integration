== Kotlin DSL

The Kotlin DSL is a wrapper and extension to <<./dsl.adoc#java-dsl,Java DSL>> and aimed to make Spring Integration development on Kotlin as smooth and straightforward as possible with interoperability with the existing Java API and Kotlin language-specific structures.

All you need to get started is just an import for `org.springframework.integration.dsl.integrationFlow` - an overloaded global function for Kotlin DSL.

For `IntegrationFlow` definitions as lambdas we typically don't need anything else from Kotlin and just declare a bean like this:

====
[source, kotlin]
----
@Bean
fun oddFlow() =
IntegrationFlow { flow ->
    flow.handle<Any> { _, _ -> "odd" }
}
----
====

In this case Kotlin understands that the lambda should be translated into `IntegrationFlow` anonymous instance and target Java DSL processor parses this construction properly into Java objects.

As an alternative to the construction above and for consistency with use-cases explained below, a Kotlin-specific DSL should be used for declaring integration flows in the *builder* pattern style:

====
[source, kotlin]
----
@Bean
fun flowLambda() =
    integrationFlow {
        filter<String> { it === "test" }
        wireTap {
                    handle { println(it.payload) }
                }
        transform<String> { it.toUpperCase() }
    }
----
====

Such a global `integrationFlow()` function expects a lambda in builder style for a `KotlinIntegrationFlowDefinition` (a Kotlin wrapper for the `IntegrationFlowDefinition`) and produces a regular `IntegrationFlow` lambda implementation.
See more overloaded `integrationFlow()` variants below.

Many other scenarios require an `IntegrationFlow` to be started from source of data (e.g. `JdbcPollingChannelAdapter`, `JmsInboundGateway` or just an existing `MessageChannel`).
For this purpose, the Spring Integration Java DSL provides an `IntegrationFlow` fluent API with its large number of overloaded `from()` methods.
This API can be used in Kotlin as well:

====
[source, kotlin]
----
@Bean
fun flowFromSupplier() =
         IntegrationFlow.fromSupplier({ "bar" }) { e -> e.poller { p -> p.fixedDelay(10).maxMessagesPerPoll(1) } }
                 .channel { c -> c.queue("fromSupplierQueue") }
                 .get()
----
====

But unfortunately not all `from()` methods are compatible with Kotlin structures.
To fix the gap, this project provides a Kotlin DSL around an `IntegrationFlow` fluent API.
It is implemented as a set of overloaded `integrationFlow()` functions.
With a consumer for a `KotlinIntegrationFlowDefinition` to declare the rest of the flow as an `IntegrationFlow` lambda to reuse the mentioned above experience and also avoid `get()` call in the end.
For example:

====
[source, kotlin]
----
@Bean
fun functionFlow() =
        integrationFlow<Function<String, String>>({ beanName("functionGateway") }) {
            transform<String> { it.toUpperCase() }
        }

@Bean
fun messageSourceFlow() =
        integrationFlow(MessageProcessorMessageSource { "testSource" },
                { poller { it.fixedDelay(10).maxMessagesPerPoll(1) } }) {
            channel { queue("fromSupplierQueue") }
        }
----
====

In addition, Kotlin extensions are provided for the Java DSL API which needs some refinement for Kotlin structures.
For example `IntegrationFlowDefinition<*>` requires a reifying for many methods with `Class<P>` argument:

====
[source, kotlin]
----
@Bean
fun convertFlow() =
    integrationFlow("convertFlowInput") {
        convert<TestPojo>()
    }
----
====

NOTE: The reified type can be a whole `Message<*>` if there need access to headers as well in the lambda of the operator.
