== GraphQL Support

Spring Integration provides channel adapters for interaction with https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] protocol.
The implementation is based on the https://spring.io/projects/spring-graphql[Spring for GraphQL].

You need to include this dependency into your project:

====
[source, xml, subs="normal", role="primary"]
.Maven
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-integration-graphql</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----
[source, groovy, subs="normal", role="secondary"]
.Gradle
----
compile "org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-graphql:{project-version}"

[[graphql-outbound-gateway]]
=== GraphQL Outbound Gateway

The `GraphQlMessageHandler` is an `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler` extension representing an outbound gateway contract to perform GraphQL `query`, `mutation` or `subscription` operation and produce their result.
It requires a `org.springframework.graphql.ExecutionGraphQlService` for execution of an `operation`, which can be configured statically or via SpEL expression against a request message.
The `operationName` is optional and also can be configured statically or via SpEL expression.
The `variablesExpression` is also optional and used for parametrized operations.
The `locale` is optional and used for operation execution context in the https://www.graphql-java.com/[GraphQL Java] library.
The `executionId` can be configured via SpEL expression and defaults to `id` header of the request message.

If the payload of the request message is an instance of `ExecutionGraphQlRequest`, then there's no any setup actions are performed in the `GraphQlMessageHandler` and such an input is used as is for the `ExecutionGraphQlService.execute()`.
Otherwise, the `operation`, `operationName`, `variables` and `executionId` are determined against request message using SpEL expressions mentioned above.

The `GraphQlMessageHandler` is a reactive streams component and produces a `Mono<ExecutionGraphQlResponse>` reply as a result of the `ExecutionGraphQlService.execute(ExecutionGraphQlRequest)`.
Such a `Mono` is subscribed by the framework in the `ReactiveStreamsSubscribableChannel` output channel or in the `AbstractMessageProducingHandler` asynchronously when the output channel is not reactive.
See documentation for the `ExecutionGraphQlResponse` how to process the GraphQL operation result.

@Bean
GraphQlMessageHandlerSpec graphQlMessageHandlerSpec(ExecutionGraphQlService graphQlService) {
    return GraphQl.gateway(graphQlService)
            .operation("""
                    query HeroNameAndFriends($episode: Episode) {
                      hero(episode: $episode) {
                        name
                        friends {
                          name
                        }
                      }
                    }""")
            .variablesExpression("{episode:'JEDI'}");
}

@Bean
IntegrationFlow graphqlQueryMessageHandlerFlow(GraphQlMessageHandler handler) {
    return IntegrationFlow.from(MessageChannels.flux("inputChannel"))
            .handle(handler)
            .channel(c -> c.flux("resultChannel"))
            .get();

    return GraphQlSource.builder()
            .schemaResources(new ClassPathResource("graphql/test-schema.graphqls"))
            .configureRuntimeWiring(annotatedDataFetcherConfigurer)
            .build();
}

@Bean
AnnotatedControllerConfigurer annotatedDataFetcherConfigurer() {
    return new AnnotatedControllerConfigurer();
}

The special treatment should be applied for the result of a subscription operation.
In this case the `ExecutionGraphQlResponse.getData()` returns a `SubscriptionPublisher` which has to subscribed and processed manually.
Or it can be flat-mapped via plain service activator to the reply for the `FluxMessageChannel`:

====
[source, java]
----
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "graphQlResultChannel", outputChannel="graphQlSubscriptionChannel")
public SubscriptionPublisher obtainSubscriptionResult(ExecutionGraphQlResponse graphQlResponse) {
	return graphQlResponse.getData();
}
----
====

Such an outbound gateway can be used not only for GraphQL request via HTTP, but from any upstream endpoint which produces or carries a GraphQL operation or its arguments in the message.
The result of the `GraphQlMessageHandler` handling can be produced as a reply to the upstream request or sent downstream for further processing in the integration flow.
