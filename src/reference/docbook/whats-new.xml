                Spring Integration 2.1 provides two new Outbound Gateways in order
                to interact with remote File Transfer Protocol (FTP) or

                For instance, you can use these Outbound Gateways to list, retrieve and

            <para>
                Router parameters have been standardized across all router
                implementations with Spring Integration 2.1 providing a more
                consistent user experience.
            </para>
            <para>
                With Spring Integration 2.1 the <code>ignore-channel-name-resolution-failures</code>
                attribute has been removed in favor of consolidating its behavior
                with the <code>resolution-required</code> attribute. Also,
                the <code>resolution-required</code> attribute now defaults to <code>true</code>.
            </para>
            <para>
                Starting with Spring Integration 2.1, routers will no longer silently
                drop any messages, if no default output channel was defined. This means,
                that by default routers now require at least one resolved channel (if no
                <code>default-output-channel</code> was set) and
                by default will throw a <classname>MessageDeliveryException</classname>
                if no channel was determined (or an attempt to send was not successful).
            </para>
            <para>

            <important>
                With the standardization of Router parameters and the consolidation

                use the version-less schema. Generally, the best option is to
                use version-less namespaces, as these will automatically use the
