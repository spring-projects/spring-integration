		<section id="3.0-tcp-events">
			<title>TCP/IP Connection Events and Connection Management</title>
			<para>
				The (supplied) <classname>TcpConnection</classname>s now emit
				<interfacename>ApplicationEvent</interfacename>s (specifically
				<classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s) when connections are
				opened, closed, or an exception occurs. This allows applications
				to be informed of changes to TCP connections using the normal
				Spring <interfacename>ApplicationListener</interfacename>
				mechanism.
			</para>
			<para>
				<classname>AbstractTcpConnection</classname> has been renamed
				<classname>TcpConnectionSupport</classname>; custom connections that
				are subclasses of this class, can use its methods to publish events.
				Similarly, <classname>AbstractTcpConnectionInterceptor</classname> has
				been renamed to <classname>TcpConnectionInterceptorSupport</classname>.
			</para>
			<para>
				In addition, a new <code>&lt;int-ip:tcp-connection-event-inbound-channel-adapter/&gt;</code>
				is provided; by default, this adapter sends all <classname>TcpConnectionEvent</classname>s
				to a <interfacename>Channel</interfacename>.
			</para>
			<para>
				Further, the TCP Connection Factories, now provide a new method
				<code>getOpenConnectionIds()</code>, which returns a list of identifiers for all
				open connections; this allows applications, for example, to broadcast to all
				open connections.
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, the connection factories also provide a new method
				<code>closeConnection(String connectionId)</code> which allows applications
				to explicitly close a connection using its ID.

		<section id="3.0-syslog">
			<title>Syslog Support</title>
			<para>
				Building on the 2.2 <classname>SyslogToMapTransformer</classname> Spring
				Integration 3.0 now introduces
				<code>UDP</code> and <code>TCP</code> inbound channel adapters especially tailored
				for receiving SYSLOG messages. For more information, see
				<xref linkend="syslog"/>.
			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-jmx">
			<title>JMX Support</title>
			<para>
				A new <code>&lt;int-jmx:tree-polling-channel-adapter/&gt;</code> is provided; this
				adapter queries the JMX MBean tree and sends a message with a payload that is the
				graph of objects that matches the query. By default the MBeans are mapped to
				primitives and simple Objects like Map, List and arrays - permitting simple
				transformation, for example, to JSON
				<xref linkend="jmx"/>.

		<section id="3.0-request-mapping">
			<title>HTTP Request Mapping</title>
			<para>
				The HTTP module now provides powerful Request Mapping support for Inbound Endpoints. Class <classname>UriPathHandlerMapping</classname>
				was replaced by <classname>IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping</classname>, which is registered under the bean name
				<code>integrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping</code> in the application context. Upon parsing of the HTTP Inbound Endpoint,
				a new <classname>IntegrationRequestMappingHandlerMapping</classname> bean is either registered or an existing bean is being reused.
				To achieve flexible Request Mapping configuration, Spring Integration provides the <code>&lt;request-mapping/&gt;</code>
				sub-element for <code>&lt;http:inbound-channel-adapter/&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;http:inbound-gateway/&gt;</code>.
				Both HTTP Inbound Endpoints are now fully based on the Request Mapping infrastructure that was introduced with Spring MVC 3.1.

			<title>Advising Filters</title>
			<para>
				Previously, when a &lt;filter/&gt; had a &lt;request-handler-advice-chain/&gt;, the discard
				action was all performed within the scope of the advice chain (including any downstream flow
				on the <code>discard-channel</code>). The filter element now has an attribute
				<code>discard-within-advice</code> (default <code>true</code>), to allow the discard action to

		<section id="3.0-ftp-cache-changes">
			<title>FTP, SFTP and FTPS Cached Sessions</title>
		    <para>
		        The FTP, SFTP and FTPS endpoints no longer cache sessions by default.
		    </para>
			<para>
			    The deprecated <code>cached-sessions</code> attribute has been removed from all endpoints.
			    Previously, the embedded caching mechanism controlled by this attribute's value didn't
			    provide a way to limit the size of the cache, which could
			    grow indefinitely. The <classname>CachingConnectionFactory</classname> was introduced in
			    release 2.1 and it became the preferred (and is now the only) way to cache sessions.
			    For more information, see

			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-xFTP-ib">
			<title>FTP, SFTP and FTPS Inbound Adapters</title>
			<para>
				Previously, there was no way to override the default filter used to process files retrieved
				from a remote server. The <code>filter</code> attribute determines which files are retrieved
				but the <classname>FileReadingMessageSource</classname> uses an
				<classname>AcceptOnceFileListFilter</classname>. This means that if a new copy of a file
				is retrieved, with the same name as a previously copied file, no message was sent from the
				adapter.
			</para>
			<para>
				With this release, a new attribute <code>local-filter</code> allows you to override the
				default filter, for example with an <classname>AcceptAllFileListFilter</classname>, or some
				other custom filter.
			</para>
			<para>
				For users that wish the behavior of the <classname>AcceptOnceFileListFilter</classname>
				to be maintained across JVM executions, a custom filter that retains state, perhaps on
				the file system, can now be configured.

		<section id="3.0-amqp-mapping">
			<title>AMQP Outbound Gateway Header Mapping</title>
			<para>
				Previously, the &lt;int-amqp:outbound-gateway/&gt; mapped headers before invoking the message
				converter, and the converter could overwrite headers such as <code>content-type</code>. The
				outbound adapter maps the headers after the conversion, which means headers like
				<code>content-type</code> from the outbound <code>Message</code> (if present) are used.
			</para>
			<para>
				Starting with this release, the gateway now maps the headers after the message conversion,
				consistent with the adapter. If your application relies on the previous behavior (where the
				converter's headers overrode the mapped headers), you either need to filter those headers
				(before the message reaches the gateway)
				or set them appropriately. The headers affected by the <classname>SimpleMessageConverter</classname>
				are <code>content-type</code> and <code>content-encoding</code>. Custom message converters
				may set other headers.

				Previously, the <emphasis>id</emphasis> attribute for elements within a <code>&lt;chain&gt;</code> was
				ignored and, in some cases, disallowed. Now, the <emphasis>id</emphasis> attribute is allowed
				for all elements within a <code>&lt;chain&gt;</code>. The bean names of chain elements is a combination
				of the surrounding chain's <emphasis>id</emphasis> and the <emphasis>id</emphasis> of the element

		<section id="3.0-jms-mdca-te">
			<title>JMS Message Driven Channel Adapter</title>
			<para>
				Previously, when configuring a <code>&lt;message-driven-channel-adapter/&gt;</code>, if you wished to
				use a specific <interfacename>TaskExecutor</interfacename>, it was necessary to declare a container
				bean and provide it to the adapter using the <code>container</code> attribute. The
				<code>task-executor</code> is now provided, allowing it to be set directly on the adapter. This is
				in addition to several other container attributes that were already available.

		<section id="3.0-message-id">
			<title>Message ID Generation</title>
			<para>
				Previously, message ids were generated using the JDK <code>UUID.randomUUID()</code> method. With this

		<section id="3.0-tcp-headers">
			<title>Message Headers and TCP</title>
			<para>
				The TCP connection factories now enable the configuration of a flexible mechanism to
				transfer selected headers (as well as the payload) over TCP. A new
				<classname>TcpMessageMapper</classname>
				enables the selection of the headers, and an appropriate (de)serializer needs to be
				configured to write the resulting <interfacename>Map</interfacename> to the
				TCP stream. A <classname>MapJsonSerializer</classname> is provided as a convenient
				mechanism to transfer headers and payload over TCP.

			</para>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-outbound-gateway-requires-reply">
			<title>'requires-reply' Attribute for Outbound Gateways</title>
			<para>
				All Outbound Gateways (e.g. <code>&lt;jdbc:outbound-gateway/&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;jms:outbound-gateway/&gt;</code>)
				are designed for 'request-reply' scenarios. A response is expected from the external service and
				will be published to the <code>reply-channel</code>, or the <code>replyChannel</code> message header.
				However, there are some cases where the external system might not always return a
				result, e.g. a <code>&lt;jdbc:outbound-gateway/&gt;</code>, when a SELECT ends with an empty <interfacename>ResultSet</interfacename>
				or, say, a Web Service is One-Way. An option is therefore needed to configure whether or not a
				<emphasis>reply</emphasis> is required.
				For this purpose, the <emphasis>requires-reply</emphasis> attribute has been introduced for Outbound Gateway components.
				In most cases, the default value for <emphasis>requires-reply</emphasis> is <code>true</code> and, if there is not any result,
				a <classname>ReplyRequiredException</classname> will be thrown. Changing the value to <code>false</code>
				means that, if an external service doesn't return anything, the message-flow will end at that point,
				similar to an Outbound Channel Adapter.
			</para>
			<note>
				The WebService outbound gateway has an additional attribute <code>ignore-empty-responses</code>; this is used to
				treat an empty String response as if no response was received. It is true by default but can be set to false to
				allow the application to receive an empty String in the reply message payload. When the attribute is true an empty
				string is treated as no response for the purposes of the <emphasis>requires-reply</emphasis> attribute.
				<emphasis>requires-reply</emphasis> is false by default for the WebService outbound gateway.
			</note>
			<para>
				Note, the <code>requiresReply</code> property was previously present in the <classname>AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler</classname>
				but set to <code>false</code>, and there wasn't any way to configure it on Outbound Gateways using the XML namespace.
			</para>
			<important>
				Previously, a gateway receiving no reply would silently end the flow (with a DEBUG log message); with this change an
				exception will now be thrown by default by most gateways. To revert to the previous behavior,
				set <code>requires-reply</code> to false.
			</important>
		</section>
		<section id="3.0-dalay-expression">
			<title>Delayer: delay expression</title>
			<para>
				Previously, the <code>&lt;delayer&gt;</code> provided a <code>delay-header-name</code> attribute
				to determine the <emphasis>delay</emphasis> value at runtime. In complex cases it was necessary
				to precede the <code>&lt;delayer&gt;</code> with a <code>&lt;header-enricher&gt;</code>.
				Spring Integration 3.0 introduced the <code>expression</code> attribute and <code>expression</code>
				sub-element for dynamic delay determination. The <code>delay-header-name</code> attribute is now deprecated
				because the header evaluation can be specified in the <code>expression</code>. In addition,
				the <code>ignore-expression-failures</code> was introduced to control the behavior when an
				expression evaluation fails.

		<section id="3.0-pub-sub">
			<title>PublishSubscribeChannel Behavior</title>
			<para>
				Previously, sending to a &lt;publish-subscribe-channel/&gt; that had
				no subscribers would return a <code>false</code> result. If used in conjunction with
				a <classname>MessagingTemplate</classname>, this would result in an exception being thrown.
				Now, the <classname>PublishSubscribeChannel</classname> has a property
				<code>minSubscribers</code> (default 0). If the message is sent to at least the minimum
				number of subscribers, the send is deemed to be successful (even if zero). If an application
				is expecting to get an exception under these conditions, set the minimum subscribers to at
