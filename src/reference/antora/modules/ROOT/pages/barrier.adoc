[[barrier]]
= Thread Barrier

Sometimes, we need to suspend a message flow thread until some other asynchronous event occurs.
For example, consider an HTTP request that publishes a message to RabbitMQ.
We might wish to not reply to the user until the RabbitMQ broker has issued an acknowledgment that the message was received.

In version 4.2, Spring Integration introduced the `<barrier/>` component for this purpose.
The underlying `MessageHandler` is the `BarrierMessageHandler`.
This class also implements `MessageTriggerAction`, in which a message passed to the `trigger()` method releases a corresponding thread in the `handleRequestMessage()` method (if present).

The suspended thread and trigger thread are correlated by invoking a `CorrelationStrategy` on the messages.
When a message is sent to the `input-channel`, the thread is suspended for up to `requestTimeout` milliseconds, waiting for a corresponding trigger message.
The default correlation strategy uses the `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.CORRELATION_ID` header.
When a trigger message arrives with the same correlation, the thread is released.
The message sent to the `output-channel` after release is constructed by using a `MessageGroupProcessor`.
By default, the message is a `Collection<?>` of the two payloads, and the headers are merged by using a `DefaultAggregatingMessageGroupProcessor`.

CAUTION: If the `trigger()` method is invoked first (or after the main thread times out), it is suspended for up to `triggerTimeout` waiting for the suspending message to arrive.
If you do not want to suspend the trigger thread, consider handing off to a `TaskExecutor` instead so that its thread is suspended instead.

NOTE: Prior version 5.4, there was only one `timeout` option for both request and trigger messages, but in some use-case it is better to have different timeouts for those actions.
Therefore `requestTimeout` and `triggerTimeout` options have been introduced.

The `requires-reply` property determines the action to take if the suspended thread times out before the trigger message arrives.
By default, it is `false`, which means the endpoint returns `null`, the flow ends, and the thread returns to the caller.
When `true`, a `ReplyRequiredException` is thrown.

You can call the `trigger()` method programmatically (obtain the bean reference by using the name, `barrier.handler` -- where `barrier` is the bean name of the barrier endpoint).
Alternatively, you can configure an `<outbound-channel-adapter/>` to trigger the release.

IMPORTANT: Only one thread can be suspended with the same correlation.
The same correlation can be used multiple times but only once concurrently.
An exception is thrown if a second thread arrives with the same correlation.

The following example shows how to use a custom header for correlation:

    barrier.setDiscardChannel(lateTriggerChannel);
    return barrier;

        timeout="10000">
</int:barrier>

<int:outbound-channel-adapter channel="release" ref="barrier1.handler" method="trigger" />
----
======

Depending on which one has a message arrive first, either the thread sending a message to `in` or the thread sending a message to `release` waits for up to ten seconds until the other message arrives.
When the message is released, the `out` channel is sent a message that combines the result of invoking the custom `MessageGroupProcessor` bean, named `myOutputProcessor`.
If the main thread times out and a trigger arrives later, you can configure a discard channel to which the late trigger is sent.
The trigger message is also discarded if request message does not arrive in time.
