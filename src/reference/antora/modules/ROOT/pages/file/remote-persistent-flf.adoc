= Remote Persistent File List Filters

Inbound and streaming inbound remote file channel adapters (`FTP`, `SFTP`, and other technologies) are configured with corresponding implementations of `AbstractPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` by default, configured with an in-memory `MetadataStore`.
To run in a cluster, these can be replaced with filters using a shared `MetadataStore` (see xref:meta-data-store.adoc[Metadata Store] for more information).
These filters are used to prevent fetching the same file multiple times (unless its modified time changes).
Starting with version 5.2, a file is added to the filter immediately before the file is fetched (and reversed if the fetch fails).

Starting with version 7.0, all the `AbstractPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` implementations uses a "long file name" (fetching directory plus simple file name) for the metadata entry key.
Perviously, just a file name may cause the metadata overriding problem when the same filter is used for different directories with same file names.
For example, the `RotatingServerAdvice` may switch to directories based on the timestamp, but files are placed there with the same name according to business logic.
If `directory1` and `directory2` contain a `someFile`, the metadata for them is stored with a `directory1/someFile` and `directory2/someFile`, respectively.
That is if filter's `prefix` option is provided as an empty string, otherwise such a prefix is added to the final key.

IMPORTANT: In the event of a catastrophic failure (such as power loss), it is possible that the file currently being fetched will remain in the filter and won't be re-fetched when restarting the application.
In this case you would need to manually remove this file from the `MetadataStore`.

In previous versions, the files were filtered before any were fetched, meaning that several files could be in this state after a catastrophic failure.

In order to facilitate this new behavior, two new methods have been added to `FileListFilter`.

[source, java]
----
boolean accept(F file);

boolean supportsSingleFileFiltering();
----

If a filter returns `true` in `supportsSingleFileFiltering`, it **must** implement `accept()`.

If a remote filter does not support single file filtering (such as the `AbstractMarkerFilePresentFileListFilter`), the adapters revert to the previous behavior.

If multiple filters are in used(a `CompositeFileListFilter` or `ChainFileListFilter`), then **all** of the delegate filters must support single file filtering in order for the composite filter to support it.

The persistent file list filters now have a boolean property `forRecursion`.
Setting this property to `true`, also sets `alwaysAcceptDirectories`, which means that the recursive operation on the outbound gateways (`ls` and `mget`) will now always traverse the full directory tree each time.
This is to solve a problem where changes deep in the directory tree were not detected.
In addition, `forRecursion=true` causes the full path to files to be used as the metadata store keys; this solves a problem where the filter did not work properly if a file with the same name appears multiple times in different directories.
IMPORTANT: This means that existing keys in a persistent metadata store will not be found for files beneath the top level directory.
For this reason, the property is `false` by default; this may change in a future release.
