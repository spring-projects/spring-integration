[[amqp-1.0]]
= AMQP 1.0 Support

Starting with version 7.0, Spring Integration provides channel adapters for RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 support.
These channel adapters are based on the `org.springframework.amqp:spring-rabbitmq-client` library.

The Spring AMQP documentation provides more details about https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference/4.0/rabbitmq-amqp-client.html[RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 support].

[[amqp-1.0-outbound]]
== AMQP 1.0 Outbound Channel Adapters

The `AmqpClientMessageHandler` is an `AbstractReplyProducingMessageHandler` implementation and can act as a one-way channel adapter or as an outbound gateway depending on the `setRequiresReply()` configuration.
The instance of this channel adapter requires an `AsyncAmqpTemplate` implementation for AMQP 1.0 protocol, e.g. `RabbitAmqpTemplate` from the mentioned above `spring-rabbitmq-client` library.
This message handler is asynchronous by default; therefore, publication errors should be handled via `errorChannel` header in the request message or global default `errorChannel` in the application context.

The `exchange` to publish message (together with optional `routingKey`) is mutually exclusive with a `queue` to publish.
If neither is provided, then `AsyncAmqpTemplate` implementation must ensure some defaults for those destination parts; otherwise the message is going to be rejected as not delivered.

By default, the `MessageConverter` is an `org.springframework.amqp.support.converter.SimpleMessageConverter` that handles String, Serializable instances, and byte arrays.
Also, a default `AmqpHeaderMapper` is a xref:amqp/message-headers.adoc[`DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.outboundMapper()`].
This header mapper is also used for mapping AMQP message properties to headers back on the reply.

In a gateway mode, the `replyPayloadType` could be supplied to convert a reply message body.
However, the `MessageConverter` has to be an implementation of the `SmartMessageConverter` like a `JacksonJsonMessageConverter`.
Also, a mutually exclusive to the `replyPayloadType`, a `returnMessage` flag could be set to `true` to return the whole instance of `org.springframework.amqp.core.Message` as a reply message payload.

The following example demonstrates how to configure an `AmqpClientMessageHandler` as a simple `@ServiceActivator`:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "amqpClientSendChannel")
AmqpClientMessageHandler amqpClientMessageHandler(RabbitAmqpTemplate rabbitTemplate) {
    AmqpClientMessageHandler messageHandler = new AmqpClientMessageHandler(rabbitTemplate);
    messageHandler.setExchangeExpressionString("headers[exchange]");
    messageHandler.setRoutingKeyExpressionString("headers[routingKey]");
    return messageHandler;
}
----

The gateway variant for the `AmqpClientMessageHandler` could be like:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
@ServiceActivator(inputChannel = "amqpClientSendAndReceiveChannel")
AmqpClientMessageHandler amqpClientGateway(RabbitAmqpTemplate rabbitTemplate) {
    AmqpClientMessageHandler messageHandler = new AmqpClientMessageHandler(rabbitTemplate);
    messageHandler.setRequiresReply(true);
    messageHandler.setReplyPayloadType(String.class);
    messageHandler.setMessageConverter(new JacksonJsonMessageConverter());
    messageHandler.setQueue("q1");
    return messageHandler;
}
----

[[amqp-1.0-message-driver]]
== AMQP 1.0 Message-Driver Channel Adapter

The `AmqpClientMessageProducer` is a `MessageProducerSupport` implementation as a Message-Driver Channel Adapter to consume messages from queues over RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 protocol.
It requires an `AmqpConnectionFactory` and at least one queue to consume.
Its logic internally is based on the `RabbitAmqpListenerContainer` and `IntegrationRabbitAmqpMessageListener` to relay consumed AMQP messages (after conversion) to the `outputChannel`.
Some of `RabbitAmqpListenerContainer` configuration options are exposed as setters from the `AmqpClientMessageProducer`.

By default, the `MessageConverter` is an `org.springframework.amqp.support.converter.SimpleMessageConverter` that handles String, Serializable instances, and byte arrays.
Also, a default `AmqpHeaderMapper` is a xref:amqp/message-headers.adoc[`DefaultAmqpHeaderMapper.inboundMapper()`].
The `messageConverter` option can be set to `null` to fully skip conversion (including header mapping), and return the received AMQP message as a payload of the Spring message to produce.

Also, the `AmqpClientMessageProducer` implements a `Pausable` contract and delegates to the respective `RabbitAmqpListenerContainer` API.

When `AmqpClientMessageProducer.setBatchSize() > 1`, this channel adapter works in a batch mode.
In this case received messages are gathered until the batch size is fulfilled, or `batchReceiveTimeout` period is exhausted.
All the batched AMQP messages then converted to Spring messages, and a result list is produced as a payload of a wrapping message to send to the `outputChannel`.
The batch mode gives some performance gain due to the settlement for all the batched messages at once.

When `autoSettle` flag is set to `false`, the `AcknowledgmentCallback` instance is provided as an `IntegrationMessageHeaderAccessor.ACKNOWLEDGMENT_CALLBACK` message header to make settlement decision for the received message or the whole batch.

The following example demonstrates how to configure an `AmqpClientMessageProducer` as a simple inbound endpoint:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
AmqpClientMessageProducer batchAmqpClientMessageProducer(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory,
        QueueChannel inputChannel) {

    AmqpClientMessageProducer amqpClientMessageProducer = new AmqpClientMessageProducer(connectionFactory, "q3");
    amqpClientMessageProducer.setOutputChannel(inputChannel);
    amqpClientMessageProducer.setBatchSize(2);
    return amqpClientMessageProducer;
}

[[amqp-1.0-inbound-gateway]]
== AMQP 1.0 Inbound Gateway

The `AmqpClientInboundGateway` is a `MessagingGatewaySupport` implementation for receiving request and producing replies over RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 protocol.
It is similar to the `AmqpClientMessageProducer` mentioned above and share many `RabbitAmqpListenerContainer` configuration options.
In addition, to produce AMQP 1.0 replies, the `AmqpClientInboundGateway` uses internally a `RabbitAmqpTemplate`.

For automatic replies correlation with their requests, a `replyTo` property of the request message must be supplied.
For example, the `RabbitAmqpTemplate.sendAndReceive()` relies on the `RpcClient` from RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 library which generates an exclusive and auto-deleted queue.
Alternatively, the reply address could be set as a `replyExchange`(and optional `replyRoutingKey`) or `replyQueue` (but not both) on the `AmqpClientInboundGateway` which are delegated to the `RabbitAmqpTemplate` default options.
The `messageId` or `correlationId` request message properties can be used for associating with replies.
The `RpcClient` in the `RabbitAmqpTemplate.sendAndReceive()` generates one if missed.
The `AmqpClientInboundGateway` is able to map back such a correlation key into a reply message.

The following example demonstrates how to configure an `AmqpClientInboundGateway` as a simple inbound gateway:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
AmqpClientInboundGateway amqpClientInboundGateway(AmqpConnectionFactory connectionFactory) {
    AmqpClientInboundGateway amqpClientInboundGateway = new AmqpClientInboundGateway(connectionFactory, "q1");
    amqpClientInboundGateway.setRequestChannelName("inputChannel");
    return amqpClientInboundGateway;
}
