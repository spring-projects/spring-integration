= SFTP Session Factory

IMPORTANT: As of version 3.0, sessions are no longer cached by default.
See xref:sftp/session-caching.adoc[SFTP Session Caching].

Before configuring SFTP adapters, you must configure an SFTP session factory.
You can configure the SFTP session factory with a regular bean definition, as the following example shows:

[source,xml]
----
<beans:bean id="sftpSessionFactory"
    class="org.springframework.integration.sftp.session.DefaultSftpSessionFactory">
    <beans:property name="host" value="localhost"/>
    <beans:property name="privateKey" value="classpath:META-INF/keys/sftpTest"/>
    <beans:property name="privateKeyPassphrase" value="springIntegration"/>
    <beans:property name="port" value="22"/>
    <beans:property name="user" value="kermit"/>
</beans:bean>
----

Every time an adapter requests a session object from its `SessionFactory`, a new SFTP session is created.
Under the covers, the SFTP Session Factory relies on the https://mina.apache.org/sshd-project/index.html[Apache MINA SSHD] library to provide the SFTP capabilities.

However, Spring Integration also supports the caching of SFTP sessions.
See xref:sftp/session-caching.adoc[SFTP Session Caching] for more information.

NOTE: The `DefaultSftpSessionFactory` can use an externally configured or extended `SshClient`.
For example, the `org.eclipse.jgit.internal.transport.sshd.JGitSshClient` extension from the `org.eclipse.jgit:org.eclipse.jgit.ssh.apache` library may be used to provide support for HTTP/SOCKS proxies.

[IMPORTANT]
=====
The `SshClient` supports multiple channels (operations) over a connection to the server.
By default, the Spring Integration session factory uses a separate physical connection for each channel.
Since Spring Integration 3.0, you can configure the session factory (using a boolean constructor arg - default `false`) to use a single connection to the server and create multiple `SftpClient` instances on that single connection.

When using this feature, you must wrap the session factory in a caching session factory, as xref:sftp/session-caching.adoc[described later], so that the connection is not physically closed when an operation completes.

If the cache is reset, the session is disconnected only when the last channel is closed.

The connection is refreshed if it is found to be disconnected when a new operation obtains a session.
=====

Now all you need to do is inject this SFTP session factory into your adapters.

NOTE: A more practical way to provide values for the SFTP session factory is to use Spring's https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer[property placeholder support].

Starting with version 6.2, the `DefaultSftpSessionFactory` introduces a `createSftpClient(...)` to support a custom `SftpClient`.
See a sample below of how to override `createSftpChannelSubsystem()` method in your custom `SftpClient` to add, for example, some custom `RequestHandler` for SFTP sub-system requests and replies:

[source, java]
----
@Override
protected ChannelSubsystem createSftpChannelSubsystem(ClientSession clientSession) {
    ChannelSubsystem sftpChannelSubsystem = super.createSftpChannelSubsystem(clientSession);
    sftpChannelSubsystem.addRequestHandler((channel, request, wantReply, buffer) -> ...);
    return sftpChannelSubsystem;
}

[[sftp-session-factory-properties]]
== Configuration Properties

The following list describes all the properties that are exposed by the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/sftp/session/DefaultSftpSessionFactory.html[`DefaultSftpSessionFactory`].

`isSharedSession` (constructor argument)::When `true`, a single `SftpClient` is used for all the requested `SftpSession` instances.
It defaults to `false`.

`sftpVersionSelector`::An `SftpVersionSelector` instance for SFTP protocol selection.
The default one is `SftpVersionSelector.CURRENT`.

`host`::The URL of the host to which to connect.
Required.

`hostConfig`::An `org.apache.sshd.client.config.hosts.HostConfigEntry` instance as an alternative for the user/host/port options.
Can be configured with a proxy jump property.

`port`::The port over which the SFTP connection shall be established.
If not specified, this value defaults to `22`.
If specified, this properties must be a positive number.

`user`::The remote user to use.
Required.

`knownHostsResource`::An `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` that used for a host key repository.
The content of the resource has to be the same format as OpenSSH `known_hosts` file and is required and must be pre-populated if `allowUnknownKeys` is false.

`password`::The password to authenticate against the remote host.
If a password is not provided, then the `privateKey` property is required.

`privateKey`::An `org.springframework.core.io.Resource` that represents the location of the private key used for authenticating against the remote host.
If the `privateKey` is not provided, then the `password` property is required.

`privateKeyPassphrase`::The password for the private key.
If you set `userInfo`, `privateKeyPassphrase` is not allowed .
The passphrase is obtained from that object.
Optional.

`timeout`::The timeout property is used as the socket timeout parameter, as well as the default connection timeout.
Defaults to `0`, which means, that no timeout will occur.

[[sftp-unk-keys]]
`allowUnknownKeys`::Set to `true` to allow connections to hosts with unknown (or changed) keys.
Its default is 'false'.
If `false`, a pre-populated `knownHosts` file is required.

`userInteraction`::A custom `org.apache.sshd.client.auth.keyboard.UserInteraction` to be used during authentication.
