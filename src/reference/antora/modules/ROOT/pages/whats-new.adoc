[[x7.1-general-changes]]

The `MessageTransformingHandler.requiresReply` flag cannot be modified: an `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown from the overridden `setRequiresReply()` method to indicate the transformer pattern cannot produce nulls for replies.
See xref:transformer.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.1-web-services-changes]]
=== Web Services Support Changes

The Web Services Outbound Gateway now can rely on the provided `WebServiceTemplate.defaultUri`.
See xref:ws.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.1-cloudevents]]
=== CloudEvents

The new `spring-integration-cloudevents` module has been introduced to support CloudEvents specification.
See xref:cloudevents.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.1-grpc]]
=== gRPC

The new `spring-integration-grpc` module has been introduced to support gRPC framework.
See xref:grpc.adoc[] for more information.


[[x7.1-testing-changes]]
=== Testing Support Changes

The `TestUtils.getPropertyValue()` with a `Class<?>` argument has been deprecated in favor of the change on the overloaded method from an `Object` return type to the generic argument.
This gives a flexible casting of the extracted value to the expected type in tests logic.
See xref:testing.adoc[] for more information.
