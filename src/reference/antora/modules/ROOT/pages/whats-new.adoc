[[spring-integration-intro-new]]
For those who are already familiar with Spring Integration, this chapter provides a brief overview of the new features of version 7.0.

If you are interested in the changes and features that were introduced in earlier versions, see the xref:history.adoc[Change History].

[[what-s-new-in-spring-integration-7-0]]
== What's New in Spring Integration 7.0?

For more details, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/issues[GitHub Issues] that were resolved as part of the 7.0 development process.

In general, the project has been moved to the latest dependency versions.
Java 17 is still the baseline, but Java 24 is supported.

[[x7.0-general]]
== General Changes

Junit 4-Based Support Components are deprecated.

The project now leverages https://jspecify.dev/docs/start-here/[JSpecify] annotations to expose null-safe APIs and to check the consistency of those nullability declarations with https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway] as part of its build.

[[x7.0-new-components]]
== New Components

A new `DistributedLock` interface has been introduced, providing new methods, `lock(Duration ttl`) and `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit, Duration ttl)`, to acquire a lock with a custom time-to-live (TTL).
See xref:distributed-locks.adoc[] for more information.

The Jackson 2 support has been deprecated for removal.
Jackson 3 is now the default with new components: `JacksonJsonObjectMapper`, `JacksonPropertyAccessor`, `JacksonIndexAccessor`, and `JacksonMessagingUtils`.
See their Javadocs for more information and deprecated classes for a migration path.

[[x7.0-jdbc-changes]]
=== JDBC Changes

The JDBC module now provides a Java DSL API via its dedicated `org.springframework.integration.jdbc.dsl.Jdbc` factory.
The xref:jdbc/dsl.adoc[] chapter provides more details.

The `JdbcLock` now supports the feature of customized time-to-live for the lock status data.
See xref:jdbc/lock-registry.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-redis-changes]]
=== Redis Changes

The `RedisLock` now supports the feature of customized time-to-live for the lock status data.
See xref:redis.adoc#redis-lock-registry[Redis Lock Registry] for more information.

[[x7.0-hazelcast-changes]]
=== Hazelcast Changes

Previously deprecated classes in the `spring-integation-hazelcast` module, such as `LeaderInitiator`, `HazelcastMembershipListener`, `HazelcastLocalInstanceRegistrar` and `HazelcastLockRegistry`, are now removed due to not supported CP-subsystem in Hazelcast library for Open Source.

[[x7.0-mqtt-changes]]
=== MQTT Changes

The `AbstractMqttMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` and `ClientManager` implementations now expose a `quiescentTimeout` option which is propagated in their `stop()` method down to the `disconnectForcibly()` API of the MQTT Paho clients.
See xref:mqtt.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-remote-files-changes]]
=== Remote Files Support Changes

The `AbstractInboundFileSynchronizer` now caches a filtered result of the `Session.list(remoteDirectory)` after slicing by the `maxFetchSize`.
So, later synchronizations deal with the cache only by the `maxFetchSize` until the cache is exhausted.
See xref:sftp/max-fetch.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-null-safety]]
=== Null Safety in  Spring Integration
The Spring Integration team and community contributors have updated the codebase to use JSpecify and NullAway, implementing a comprehensive null safety implementation that uses `@NullMarked` annotations to default all types to non-null at the package level and `@Nullable` annotations to explicitly mark types that can be null.
NullAway provides build-time verification that breaks the build if null safety violations are detected, aligning with a https://spring.io/blog/2025/03/10/null-safety-in-spring-apps-with-jspecify-and-null-away[goal] set by the Spring Framework team for the 7.x release.
The implementation provides automatic IDE warnings and enforces explicit null handling at compile time, with the goal of significantly reducing or eliminating NullPointerExceptions in production by making nullness explicit in APIs across Spring Integration.
