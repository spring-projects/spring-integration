[[spring-integration-intro-new]]
For those who are already familiar with Spring Integration, this chapter provides a brief overview of the new features of version 7.0.

If you are interested in the changes and features that were introduced in earlier versions, see the xref:history.adoc[Change History].

[[what-s-new-in-spring-integration-7-0]]
== What's New in Spring Integration 7.0?

For more details, see the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/issues[GitHub Issues] that were resolved as part of the 7.0 development process.

In general, the project has been moved to the latest dependency versions.
Java 17 is still the baseline, but Java 24 is supported.

[[x7.0-general]]
== General Changes

Junit 4-Based Support Components are deprecated.

The project now leverages https://jspecify.dev/docs/start-here/[JSpecify] annotations to expose null-safe APIs and to check the consistency of those nullability declarations with https://github.com/uber/NullAway[NullAway] as part of its build.

The `spring-retry` dependency, together with all its API usage have been replaced by retry API in Spring Framework Core module.
This breaking change is the natural evolution of the whole Spring portfolio.
In general, the following references have been migrated:

- `org.springframework.retry.support.RetryTemplate` -> `org.springframework.core.retry.RetryTemplate`;
- `org.springframework.retry.RetryPolicy` -> `org.springframework.core.retry.RetryPolicy`;
- `org.springframework.retry.RecoveryCallback` -> `org.springframework.integration.core.RecoveryCallback`.
There is no `RecoveryCallback` abstraction in the Spring Framework, since regular `try..catch` on the `RetryException` is enough.
For Spring Integration, the `RecoveryCallback` makes sense as a dead-letter publisher to an error channel;
- `org.springframework.retry.backoff.BackOffPolicy` -> `org.springframework.util.backoff.BackOff`.
However, it is not exposed directly as a `RetryTemplate` options: rather as an internal API backed by the configuration via `RetryPolicy.Builder`;
- The `RetryContext` in AMPQ, JMS and Apache Kafka channel adapters is replaced with an internal `AttributeAccessor` implementation.

Therefore, the following project classes have suffered breaking changes:

- `AmqpBaseInboundChannelAdapterSpec`
- `AmqpBaseInboundGatewaySpec`
- `AmqpInboundChannelAdapter`
- `AmqpInboundGateway`
- `PostgresSubscribableChannel`
- `ChannelPublishingJmsMessageListener`
- `JmsInboundGatewaySpec`
- `JmsMessageDrivenChannelAdapterSpec`
- `KafkaInboundGatewaySpec`
- `KafkaMessageDrivenChannelAdapterSpec`
- `KafkaInboundEndpoint`
- `KafkaInboundGateway`
- `KafkaMessageDrivenChannelAdapter`

The `RequestHandlerRetryAdvice` was rebuilt to avoid external API as much as possible.
For the stateless retry logic, there is just enough to provide a `org.springframework.core.retry.RetryPolicy`.
The stateful retry logic is activated by the `Function<Message<?>, Object> stateKeyFunction`.
The `RetryStateGenerator` abstraction and its `SpelExpressionRetryStateGenerator` implementation have been removed due to dependency on the `spring-retry` API.

See xref:handler-advice/classes.adoc#retry-advice[Retry Advice] for more information.

All the modules now follow the standard package structure.
The inbound and outbound components are declared in the `inbound` and `outbound` packages, respectively.
The `MessageChannel` implementations in the `channel` package.
Most of the modules have followed this rule from day one.
The refactoring for package structure in this version includes the rest of modules: `spring-integration-file`, `spring-integration-ftp`, `spring-integration-ip`, `spring-integration-jdbc`, `spring-integration-jms`, `spring-integration-jmx`, `spring-integration-mail`, `spring-integration-sftp`, `spring-integration-stream` and `spring-integration-ws`.
The classes which were in root packages are marked now as deprecated.

[[x7.0-new-components]]
== New Components

A new `DistributedLock` interface has been introduced, providing new methods, `lock(Duration ttl`) and `tryLock(long time, TimeUnit unit, Duration ttl)`, to acquire a lock with a custom time-to-live (TTL).
See xref:distributed-locks.adoc[] for more information.

The Jackson 2 support has been deprecated for removal.
Jackson 3 is now the default with new components: `JacksonJsonObjectMapper`, `JacksonPropertyAccessor`, `JacksonIndexAccessor`, and `JacksonMessagingUtils`.
See their Javadocs for more information and deprecated classes for a migration path.

The `spring-integration-amqp` module now implements channel adapters for RabbitMQ AMQP 1.0 support.
The dedicated xref:amqp/amqp-1.0.adoc[AMQP 1.0 Support] chapter provides more information.

[[x7.0-jdbc-changes]]
=== JDBC Changes

The JDBC module now provides a Java DSL API via its dedicated `org.springframework.integration.jdbc.dsl.Jdbc` factory.
The xref:jdbc/dsl.adoc[] chapter provides more details.

The `JdbcLock` now supports the feature of customized time-to-live for the lock status data.
See xref:jdbc/lock-registry.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-redis-changes]]
=== Redis Changes

The `RedisLock` now supports the feature of customized time-to-live for the lock status data.
See xref:redis.adoc#redis-lock-registry[Redis Lock Registry] for more information.

[[x7.0-hazelcast-changes]]
=== Hazelcast Changes

Previously deprecated classes in the `spring-integation-hazelcast` module, such as `LeaderInitiator`, `HazelcastMembershipListener`, `HazelcastLocalInstanceRegistrar` and `HazelcastLockRegistry`, are now removed due to not supported CP-subsystem in Hazelcast library for Open Source.

[[x7.0-mqtt-changes]]
=== MQTT Changes

The `AbstractMqttMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` and `ClientManager` implementations now expose a `quiescentTimeout` option which is propagated in their `stop()` method down to the `disconnectForcibly()` API of the MQTT Paho clients.
See xref:mqtt.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-files-changes]]
=== Files Changes

The `FileReadingMessageSource` now can be configured with a SpEL `Expression` for its `directory` property.
See xref:file/reading.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-remote-files-changes]]
=== Remote Files Support Changes

The `AbstractInboundFileSynchronizer` now caches a filtered result of the `Session.list(remoteDirectory)` after slicing by the `maxFetchSize`.
So, later synchronizations deal with the cache only by the `maxFetchSize` until the cache is exhausted.
See xref:sftp/max-fetch.adoc[] for more information.

All the `AbstractPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` implementations now use a "long file name" for the metadata entry key.
Previously, just a file name may cause the metadata overriding problem when the same filter is used for different directories with same file names.
For example, the `RotatingServerAdvice` may switch to directories based on the timestamp, but files are placed there with the same name according to business logic.
See xref:file/remote-persistent-flf.adoc[Remote Persistent File List Filters] for more information.

[[x7.0-null-safety]]
=== Null Safety
Updated the codebase to use JSpecify and NullAway, adding a comprehensive null safety implementation that uses `@NullMarked` annotations to default all types to non-null at the package level and `@Nullable` annotations to explicitly mark types that can be null.
See xref:null-safety.adoc[] for more information.

[[x7.0-cloudevents]]
=== CloudEvents

The CloudEvent transformer converts Spring Integration messages into CloudEvent compliant messages.
This transformer provides support for the CloudEvents specification v1.0 with configurable output formats, header pattern matching, and extension management.
See xref:cloudevents-transform.adoc[] for more information.
