[[spring-integration-intro-new]]
For those who are already familiar with Spring Integration, this chapter provides a brief overview of the new features of version 6.5.

If you are interested in the changes and features that were introduced in earlier versions, see the xref:history.adoc[Change History].

== What's New in Spring Integration 6.5?

If you are interested in more details, see the Issue Tracker tickets that were resolved as part of the 6.5 development process.

In general the project has been moved to the latest dependency versions.

[[x6.5-general]]
== General Changes

The deprecated previously usage of `org.springframework.util.concurrent.ListenableFuture` has been removed in favor of `CompletableFuture`.

The previously deprecated SpEL-based Control Bus components have been removed in favor of functionality around `ControlBusCommandRegistry`.
The `<control-bus use-registry="">` attribute is deprecated now without replacement since only `ControlBusCommandRegistry` functionality is available.
The Java DSL `controlBusOnRegistry()` operator is deprecated in favor of restored `controlBus()` which is fully based now on the `ControlBusCommandRegistry`.
See xref:control-bus.adoc[Control Bus] for more information.

The `AbstractCorrelatingMessageHandler` does not throw an `IllegalArgumentException` for the collection of payloads as a result of the `MessageGroupProcessor`.
Instead, such a collection is wrapped into a single reply message.
See xref:aggregator.adoc[Aggregator] for more information.

The `AbstractMessageChannel` beans now throw a special `MessageDispatchingException` when an attempt to send a message to not running application is done.
In general, it is a design error to try to produce a message from `afterPropertiesSet()`, `@PostConstruct` or bean definition methods.
The `SmartLifecycle.start()` is preferred way for this kind of logic, or better to do that via inbound channel adapters.

The Java DSL `gateway()` operator now fully supports an `async(true)` behavior.
See xref:gateway.adoc[] for more information.

[[x6.5-lock-request-handler-advice]]
== The `LockRequestHandlerAdvice`

A new `LockRequestHandlerAdvice` is introduced to keep the lock for a key based on a request message for message handler invocation.
See xref:handler-advice.adoc[] for more information.

[[x6.5-correlation-changes]]
== The `discardIndividuallyOnExpiry` Option For Correlation Handlers

The aggregator and resequencer can now discard the whole expired group as a single message via setting `discardIndividuallyOnExpiry` to `false`.
See xref:aggregator.adoc#releasestrategy[ReleaseStrategy] for more information.

[[x6.5-message-store-with-locks]]
== The `LockRegistry` in the `MessageStore`

The `AbstractMessageGroupStore` now can be configured with a `LockRegistry` to perform series of persistent operation atomically.
See xref:message-store.adoc#use-lock-registry[Use LockRegistry] for more information.

[[x6.5-observation-changes]]
== Micrometer Observation Changes

The `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` endpoint now starts a `CONSUMER` kind observation for the received message.
The `MessageReceiverContext` now distinguishes between `handler`, `message-source` and `message-producer` values for the `spring.integration.type` low cardinality tag.
See xref:metrics.adoc#micrometer-observation[Micrometer Observation] for more information.

[[x6.5-mqtt-changes]]
== Optional Paho MQTT Dependencies

The `org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.client.mqttv3` dependency for `spring-integration-mqtt` is now also optional as `org.eclipse.paho:org.eclipse.paho.mqttv5.client` always was.
See xref:mqtt.adoc[MQTT Support] for more information.

[[x6.5-kafka-changes]]
== Apache Kafka support Changes

The `KafkaMessageSource` and `KafkaMessageDrivenChannelAdapter` now generate `MessageHeaders.ID` and `MessageHeaders.TIMESTAMP` headers by default as the rest of Spring Integration channel adapters.
The behavior can be restored to the previous with injection of the `MessagingMessageConverter` with default settings.
See xref:kafka.adoc[Apache Kafka Support] for more information.

[[x6.5-file-filter-changes]]
== The Recent File Filter Support

The `AbstractRecentFileListFilter` strategy has been introduced to accept only those files which are not old enough according to the provided `age`.
The respective implementations are provided: `RecentFileListFilter`, `FtpRecentFileListFilter`, `SftpRecentFileListFilter` and `SmbRecentFileListFilter`.
See xref:file/reading.adoc[Reading Files] for more information.

[[x6.5-file-exists-mode-expression]]
== FileExistsMode Expression Support

The remote file gateways (`AbstractRemoteFileOutboundGateway`) now support dynamic resolution of `FileExistsMode` at runtime via SpEL expressions. This allows determining the action to take when files already exist based on message content or other conditions.
The expression can evaluate to a `FileExistsMode` enum value or a string representation (case-insensitive). If the expression returns `null`, the default `fileExistsMode` configured on the gateway will be used.
See xref:ftp/rft.adoc[Remote File Gateways] for more information.

[[x6.5-hazelcast-changes]]
== Hazelcast Module Deprecations

The `HazelcastLockRegistry` and Hazelcast `LeaderInitiator` have been deprecated due to Hazelcast CP Subsystem migration to Enterprise Edition.
See xref:hazelcast.adoc[Hazelcast Support] for more information.

[[x6.5-jdbc-changes]]
== JDBC Support

The `BeanPropertySqlParameterSourceFactory` uses now internally the `MapSqlParameterSource` if provided input is a `Map`.
Also, `JdbcMessageHandler` exposes a `usePayloadAsParameterSource` flag to allow to deal with parameter source only against message payload.
That's where the mentioned `MapSqlParameterSource` comes useful for request messages with map payloads.
See xref:jdbc.adoc[JDBC Support] for more information.

[[x6.5-redis-changes]]
== Redis Stream Support

The `ReactiveRedisStreamMessageHandler` now exposes a `Function<Message<?>, RedisStreamCommands.XAddOptions>` to provide additional `XADD` option via convenient `RedisStreamCommands.XAddOptions` API.
See xref:redis.adoc#redis-stream-outbound[Redis Support] for more information.
