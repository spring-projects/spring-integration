= AMQP (RabbitMQ) Support

Spring Integration provides channel adapters for receiving and sending messages by using the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP).

This dependency is required for the project:

[tabs]
======
Maven::

[source, xml, subs="normal", role="primary"]

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.integration</groupId>

The following adapters are available:

* xref:amqp/outbound-channel-adapter.adoc[Outbound Channel Adapter]
* xref:amqp/outbound-gateway.adoc[Outbound Gateway]
* xref:amqp/async-outbound-gateway.adoc[Async Outbound Gateway]
* xref:amqp/rmq-streams.adoc#rmq-stream-inbound-channel-adapter[RabbitMQ Stream Queue Inbound Channel Adapter]
* xref:amqp/rmq-streams.adoc#rmq-stream-outbound-channel-adapter[RabbitMQ Stream Queue Outbound Channel Adapter]
* xref:amqp/amqp-1.0.adoc[AMQP 1.0 Channel Adapters]

Spring Integration also provides a point-to-point message channel and a publish-subscribe message channel backed by AMQP Exchanges and Queues.

To provide AMQP support, Spring Integration relies on (https://spring.io/spring-amqp[Spring AMQP]), which applies core Spring concepts to the development of AMQP-based messaging solutions.
Spring AMQP provides similar semantics to (https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/integration.html#jms[Spring JMS]).

Whereas the provided AMQP Channel Adapters are intended for unidirectional messaging (send or receive) only, Spring Integration also provides inbound and outbound AMQP gateways for request-reply operations.

TIP:
You should familiarize yourself with the https://docs.spring.io/spring-amqp/reference[reference documentation of the Spring AMQP project].
It provides much more in-depth information about Spring's integration with AMQP in general and RabbitMQ in particular.
