= FTP Inbound Channel Adapter

The FTP inbound channel adapter is a special listener that connects to the FTP server and listens for the remote directory events, (for example, a new file created) at which point it initiates a file transfer.
The following example shows how to configure an `inbound-channel-adapter`:

[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter id="ftpInbound"
    channel="ftpChannel"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    auto-create-local-directory="true"
    delete-remote-files="true"
    filename-pattern="*.txt"
    remote-directory="some/remote/path"
    remote-file-separator="/"
    preserve-timestamp="true"
    local-filename-generator-expression="#this.toUpperCase() + '.a'"
    scanner="myDirScanner"
    local-filter="myFilter"
    temporary-file-suffix=".writing"
    max-fetch-size="-1"
    local-directory=".">
    <int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>
----

As the preceding configuration shows, you can configure an FTP inbound channel adapter by using the `inbound-channel-adapter` element while also providing values for various attributes, such as `local-directory`, `filename-pattern` (which is based on simple pattern matching, not regular expressions), and the reference to a `session-factory`.

By default, the transferred file carries the same name as the original file.
If you want to override this behavior, you can set the `local-filename-generator-expression` attribute, which lets you provide a SpEL expression to generate the name of the local file.
Unlike outbound gateways and adapters, where the root object of the SpEL evaluation context is a `Message`, this inbound adapter does not yet have the message at the time of evaluation, since that's what it ultimately generates with the transferred file as its payload.
Consequently, the root object of the SpEL evaluation context is the original name of the remote file (a `String`).

The inbound channel adapter first retrieves the `File` object for a local directory and then emits each file according to the poller configuration.
Starting with version 5.0, you can now limit the number of files fetched from the FTP server when new file retrievals are needed.
This can be beneficial when the target files are very large or when you run in a clustered system with a persistent file list filter, discussed later.
Use `max-fetch-size` for this purpose.
A negative value (the default) means no limit and all matching files are retrieved.
See xref:ftp/max-fetch.adoc[Inbound Channel Adapters: Controlling Remote File Fetching] for more information.
Since version 5.0, you can also provide a custom `DirectoryScanner` implementation to the `inbound-channel-adapter` by setting the `scanner` attribute.

Starting with Spring Integration 3.0, you can specify the `preserve-timestamp` attribute (its default is `false`).
When `true`, the local file's modified timestamp is set to the value retrieved from the server.
Otherwise, it is set to the current time.

Starting with version 4.2, you can specify `remote-directory-expression` instead of `remote-directory`, letting you dynamically determine the directory on each poll -- for example, `remote-directory-expression="@myBean.determineRemoteDir()"`.

Starting with version 4.3, you can omit the `remote-directory` and `remote-directory-expression` attributes.
They default to `null`.
In this case, according to the FTP protocol, the client working directory is used as the default remote directory.

Sometimes, file filtering based on the simple pattern specified with the `filename-pattern` attribute might not suffice.
If this is the case, you can use the `filename-regex` attribute to specify a regular expression (such as `filename-regex=".*\.test$"`).
Also, if you need complete control, you can use the `filter` attribute and provide a reference to any custom implementation of the `o.s.i.file.filters.FileListFilter`, a strategy interface for filtering a list of files.
This filter determines which remote files are retrieved.
You can also combine a pattern-based filter with other filters (such as an `AcceptOnceFileListFilter` to avoid synchronizing files that have previously been fetched) by using a `CompositeFileListFilter`.

The `AcceptOnceFileListFilter` stores its state in memory.
If you wish the state to survive a system restart, consider using the `FtpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` instead.
This filter stores the accepted file names in an instance of the `MetadataStore` strategy (see xref:meta-data-store.adoc[Metadata Store]).
This filter matches on the filename and the remote modified time.

Since version 4.0, this filter requires a `ConcurrentMetadataStore`.
When used with a shared data store (such as `Redis` with the `RedisMetadataStore`), it lets filter keys be shared across multiple application or server instances.

Starting with version 5.0, the `FtpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` with in-memory `SimpleMetadataStore` is applied by default for the `FtpInboundFileSynchronizer`.
This filter is also applied with the `regex` or `pattern` option in the XML configuration as well as with `FtpInboundChannelAdapterSpec` in the Java DSL.
Any other use cases can be managed with `CompositeFileListFilter` (or `ChainFileListFilter`).

The preceding discussion refers to filtering the files before retrieving them.
Once the files have been retrieved, an additional filter is applied to the files on the file system.
By default, this is an `AcceptOnceFileListFilter` which, as discussed earlier, retains state in memory and does not consider the file's modified time.
Unless your application removes files after processing, the adapter will re-process the files on disk by default after an application restart.

Also, if you configure the `filter` to use a `FtpPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` and the remote file timestamp changes (causing it to be re-fetched), the default local filter does not let this new file be processed.

For more information about this filter and how it is used, see xref:file/remote-persistent-flf.adoc[Remote Persistent File List Filters].

You can use the `local-filter` attribute to configure the behavior of the local file system filter.
Starting with version 4.3.8, a `FileSystemPersistentAcceptOnceFileListFilter` is configured by default.
This filter stores the accepted file names and modified timestamp in an instance of the `MetadataStore` strategy (see xref:meta-data-store.adoc[Metadata Store]) and detects changes to the local file modified time.
The default `MetadataStore` is a `SimpleMetadataStore`, which stores state in memory.

Since version 4.1.5, these filters have a new property (`flushOnUpdate`) that causes them to flush the
metadata store on every update (if the store implements `Flushable`).

IMPORTANT: Further, if you use a distributed `MetadataStore` (such as xref:redis.adoc#redis-metadata-store[Redis]), you can have multiple instances of the same adapter or application and be sure that each file is processed only once.

The actual local filter is a `ChainFileListFilter` that contains a pattern filter that prevents processing files that are in the process of being downloaded (based on the `temporary-file-suffix`) and the supplied filter.
Files are downloaded with this suffix (the default is `.writing`), and the file is renamed to its final name when the transfer is complete, making it 'visible' to the filter.

The `remote-file-separator` attribute lets you configure a file separator character to use if the default '/' is not applicable for your particular environment.

See the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-integration/tree/main/spring-integration-core/src/main/resources/org/springframework/integration/config[schema] for more details on these attributes.

You should also understand that the FTP inbound channel adapter is a polling consumer.
Therefore, you must configure a poller (by using either a global default or a local subelement).
Once a file has been transferred, a message with a `java.io.File` as its payload is generated and sent to the channel identified by the `channel` attribute.

Starting with version 6.2, you can filter FTP files based on last-modified strategy using `FtpLastModifiedFileListFilter`.
This filter can be configured with an `age` property so that only files older than this value are passed by the filter.
The age defaults to 60 seconds, but you should choose an age that is large enough to avoid picking up a file early (due to, say, network glitches).
Look into its Javadoc for more information.

In contrast, starting with version 6.5, an `FtpRecentFileListFilter` has been introduced to accept only those files which are not older than provided `age`.

[[more-on-file-filtering-and-incomplete-files]]
== More on File Filtering and Incomplete Files

Sometimes the file that just appeared in the monitored (remote) directory is not complete.
Typically, such a file is written with a temporary extension (such as `somefile.txt.writing`) and is then renamed once the writing process finishes.
In most cases, you are only interested in files that are complete and would like to filter for only files that are complete.
To handle these scenarios, you can use the filtering support provided by the `filename-pattern`, `filename-regex`, and `filter` attributes.
The following example uses a custom filter implementation:

[source,xml]
----
<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter
    channel="ftpChannel"
    session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
    filter="customFilter"
    local-directory="file:/my_transfers">
    remote-directory="some/remote/path"
    <int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>

<bean id="customFilter" class="org.example.CustomFilter"/>
----

[[poller-configuration-notes-for-the-inbound-ftp-adapter]]
== Poller Configuration Notes for the Inbound FTP Adapter

The job of the inbound FTP adapter consists of two tasks:

. Communicate with a remote server in order to transfer files from a remote directory to a local directory.
. For each transferred file, generate a message with that file as a payload and send it to the channel identified by the 'channel' attribute.
That is why they are called "'channel adapters'" rather than just "'adapters'".
The main job of such an adapter is to generate a message to send to a message channel.
Essentially, the second task takes precedence in such a way that, if your local directory already has one or more files, it first generates messages from those.
Only when all local files have been processed does it initiate the remote communication to retrieve more files.

Also, when configuring a trigger on the poller, you should pay close attention to the `max-messages-per-poll` attribute.
Its default value is `1` for all `SourcePollingChannelAdapter` instances (including FTP).
This means that, as soon as one file is processed, it waits for the next execution time as determined by your trigger configuration.
If you happened to have one or more files sitting in the `local-directory`, it would process those files before it would initiate communication with the remote FTP server.
Also, if the `max-messages-per-poll` is set to `1` (the default), it processes only one file at a time with intervals as defined by your trigger, essentially working as "`one-poll === one-file`".

For typical file-transfer use cases, you most likely want the opposite behavior: to process all the files you can for each poll and only then wait for the next poll.
If that is the case, set `max-messages-per-poll` to -1.
Then, on each poll, the adapter tries to generate as many messages as it possibly can.
In other words, it processes everything in the local directory, and then it connects to the remote directory to transfer everything that is available there to be processed locally.
Only then is the poll operation considered complete, and the poller waits for the next execution time.

You can alternatively set the 'max-messages-per-poll' value to a positive value that indicates the upward limit of messages to be created from files with each poll.
For example, a value of `10` means that, on each poll, it tries to process no more than ten files.

[[recovering-from-failures]]
== Recovering from Failures

It is important to understand the architecture of the adapter.
There is a file synchronizer that fetches the files and a `FileReadingMessageSource` that emits a message for each synchronized file.
As discussed earlier, two filters are involved.
The `filter` attribute (and patterns) refers to the remote (FTP) file list, to avoid fetching files that have already been fetched.
The `local-filter` is used by the `FileReadingMessageSource` to determine which files are to be sent as messages.

The synchronizer lists the remote files and consults its filter.
The files are then transferred.
If an IO error occurs during file transfer, any files that have already been added to the filter are removed so that they are eligible to be re-fetched on the next poll.
This only applies if the filter implements `ReversibleFileListFilter` (such as the `AcceptOnceFileListFilter`).

If, after synchronizing the files, an error occurs on the downstream flow processing a file, no automatic rollback of the filter occurs, so the failed file is not reprocessed by default.

If you wish to reprocess such files after a failure, you can use configuration similar to the following to facilitate the removal of the failed file from the filter:

[source, xml]
----
<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter id="ftpAdapter"
        session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
        channel="requestChannel"
        remote-directory-expression="'/ftpSource'"
        local-directory="file:myLocalDir"
        auto-create-local-directory="true"
        filename-pattern="*.txt">
    <int:poller fixed-rate="1000">
        <int:transactional synchronization-factory="syncFactory" />
    </int:poller>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>

<bean id="acceptOnceFilter"
    class="org.springframework.integration.file.filters.AcceptOnceFileListFilter" />

<int:transaction-synchronization-factory id="syncFactory">
    <int:after-rollback expression="payload.delete()" />
</int:transaction-synchronization-factory>

<bean id="transactionManager"
    class="org.springframework.integration.transaction.PseudoTransactionManager" />
----

The preceding configuration works for any `ResettableFileListFilter`.

Starting with version 5.0, the inbound channel adapter can build subdirectories locally that correspond to the generated local file name.
That can be a remote sub-path as well.
To be able to read a local directory recursively for modification according to the hierarchy support, you can now supply an internal `FileReadingMessageSource` with a new `RecursiveDirectoryScanner` based on the `Files.walk()` algorithm.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/file/remote/synchronizer/AbstractInboundFileSynchronizingMessageSource.html#setScanner[`AbstractInboundFileSynchronizingMessageSource.setScanner()`] for more information.
Also, you can now switch the `AbstractInboundFileSynchronizingMessageSource` to the `WatchService`-based `DirectoryScanner` by using `setUseWatchService()` option.
It is also configured for all the `WatchEventType` instances to react to any modifications in local directory.
The reprocessing sample shown earlier is based on the built-in functionality of the `FileReadingMessageSource.WatchServiceDirectoryScanner` to perform `ResettableFileListFilter.remove()` when the file is deleted (`StandardWatchEventKinds.ENTRY_DELETE`) from the local directory.
See xref:file/reading.adoc#watch-service-directory-scanner[`WatchServiceDirectoryScanner`] for more information.
