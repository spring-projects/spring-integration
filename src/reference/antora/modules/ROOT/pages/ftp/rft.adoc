= Using `RemoteFileTemplate`

Starting with Spring Integration 3.0, a new abstraction is provided over the `FtpSession` object.
The template provides methods to send, retrieve (as an `InputStream`), remove, and rename files.
In addition, an `execute` method is provided allowing the caller to execute multiple operations on the session.
In all cases, the template takes care of reliably closing the session.
For more information, see the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/file/remote/RemoteFileTemplate.html[Javadoc for `RemoteFileTemplate`].
There is a subclass for FTP: `FtpRemoteFileTemplate`.

Version 4.1 added additional methods, including `getClientInstance()`, which provides access to the underlying `FTPClient` and thus gives you access to low-level APIs.

Not all FTP servers properly implement the `STAT <path>` command.
Some return a positive result for a non-existent path.
The `NLST` command reliably returns the name when the path is a file, and it exists.
However, this does not support checking that an empty directory exists since `NLST` always returns an empty list when the path is a directory.
Since the template does not know whether the path represents a directory, it has to perform additional checks when the path does not appear to exist (when using `NLST`).
This adds overhead, requiring several requests to the server.
Starting with version 4.1.9, the `FtpRemoteFileTemplate` provides the `FtpRemoteFileTemplate.ExistsMode` property, which has the following options:

* `STAT`: Perform the `STAT` FTP command (`FTPClient.getStatus(path)`) to check the path existence.
This is the default and requires that your FTP server properly support the `STAT` command (with a path).
* `NLST`: Perform the `NLST` FTP command -- `FTPClient.listName(path)`.
Use this if you are testing for a path that is a full path to a file.
It does not work for empty directories.
* `NLST_AND_DIRS`:  Perform the `NLST` command first and, if it returns no files, fall back to a technique that temporarily switches the working directory by using `FTPClient.changeWorkingDirectory(path)`.
See https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/ftp/session/FtpSession.html#exists[`FtpSession.exists()`] for more information.

Since we know that the `FileExistsMode.FAIL` case is always only looking for a file (and not a directory), we safely use `NLST` mode for the `FtpMessageHandler` and `FtpOutboundGateway` components.

For any other cases, the `FtpRemoteFileTemplate` can be extended to implement custom logic in the overridden `exist()` method.

Starting with version 5.0, the new `RemoteFileOperations.invoke(OperationsCallback<F, T> action)` method is available.
This method lets several `RemoteFileOperations` calls be called in the scope of the same, thread-bounded, `Session`.
This is useful when you need to perform several high-level operations of the `RemoteFileTemplate` as one unit of work.
For example, `AbstractRemoteFileOutboundGateway` uses it with the `mput` command implementation, where we perform a `put` operation for each file in the provided directory and recursively for its sub-directories.
See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/file/remote/RemoteFileOperations.html#invoke[Javadoc] for more information.

Starting with version 6.5, the `AbstractRemoteFileOutboundGateway` supports dynamic resolution of `FileExistsMode` at runtime via SpEL expressions.
This allows you to determine the action to take when files already exist based on message content or other conditions.

To use this feature, configure the `fileExistsModeExpression` property on the gateway.
The expression can evaluate to:

* A `FileExistsMode` enum value (e.g., `FileExistsMode.REPLACE`)
* A string representation of a `FileExistsMode` (case-insensitive, e.g., "REPLACE", "append")

If the expression returns `null`, the default `fileExistsMode` configured on the gateway will be used.

See the https://docs.spring.io/spring-integration/api/org/springframework/integration/file/remote/gateway/AbstractRemoteFileOutboundGateway.html#setFileExistsModeExpression(org.springframework.expression.Expression)[Javadoc] for more information.

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using `FileExistsMode.APPEND`, temporary filename functionality is automatically disabled regardless of the `useTemporaryFileName` setting.
This is because appending to a temporary file and then renaming it would not achieve the intended append behavior.
