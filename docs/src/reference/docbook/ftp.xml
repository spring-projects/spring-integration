  <title>FTP/FTPS Adapters</title>
  <para>
    Spring Integration provides support for file transfer operations via FTP and FTPS.
  </para>
  <section id="ftp-intro">
    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a simple network protocol which allows you to transfer files between two computers on the Internet.
    </para>
    <para>
    There are two actors when it comes to FTP communication: <emphasis>client</emphasis> and <emphasis>server</emphasis>. 
    To transfer files with FTP/FTPS, you use a <emphasis>client</emphasis> which initiates a connection to a remote computer 
    that is running an FTP <emphasis>server</emphasis>. After the connection is established, the <emphasis>client</emphasis> can choose 
    to send and/or receive copies of files. 
    </para>
    
     <para>
    Spring Integration supports sending and receiving files over FTP/FTPS by providing two types of <emphasis>client</emphasis>
    side adapters: <emphasis>Inbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> and <emphasis>Outbound Channel Adapter</emphasis>. It also provides
    convenient namespace-based configuration options for defining these <emphasis>client</emphasis> components.
    </para>
    <para>
    	To use the <emphasis>FTP</emphasis> namespace, add the following to the header of your XML file:
    	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[xmlns:ftp="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/ftp"
xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/ftp 
	http://www.springframework.org/schema/integration/ftp/spring-integration-ftp-2.0.xsd" 
]]></programlisting>
    </para>
  </section>
  
  
  <section id="ftp-session-factory">
  	<title>FTP Session Factory</title>
  	<para>
  	Before configuring FTP adapters you must configure an <emphasis>FTP Session Factory</emphasis>. You can configure 
  	the <emphasis>FTP Session Factory</emphasis> with a regular bean definition where the implementation class is <classname>org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpSessionFactory</classname>:
	Below is a basic configuration:
	
	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="ftpClientFactory" 
	class="org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpSessionFactory">
		<property name="host" value="localhost"/>
		<property name="port" value="22"/>
		<property name="username" value="kermit"/>
		<property name="password" value="frog"/>
		<property name="clientMode" value="0"/>
		<property name="fileType" value="2"/>
		<property name="bufferSize" value="100000"/>
</bean>]]></programlisting>
	</para>
	<para>
	For FTPS connections all you need to do is use <classname>org.springframework.integration.ftp.session.DefaultFtpsSessionFactory</classname> instead.
	Below is the complete configuration sample:
	
	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<bean id="ftpClientFactory" 
	class="org.springframework.integration.ftp.client.DefaultFtpsClientFactory">
		<property name="host" value="localhost"/>
		<property name="port" value="22"/>
		<property name="username" value="oleg"/>
		<property name="password" value="password"/>
		<property name="clientMode" value="1"/>
		<property name="fileType" value="2"/>
		<property name="useClientMode" value="true"/>
		<property name="cipherSuites" value="a,b.c"/>
		<property name="keyManager" ref="keyManager"/>
		<property name="protocol" value="SSL"/>
		<property name="trustManager" ref="trustManager"/>
		<property name="prot" value="P"/>
		<property name="needClientAuth" value="true"/>
		<property name="authValue" value="oleg"/>
		<property name="sessionCreation" value="true"/>
		<property name="protocols" value="SSL, TLS"/>
		<property name="implicit" value="true"/>
</bean>]]></programlisting>
	</para>


	<para>
	Every time an adapter requests a session object from the <classname>DefaultFtpClientFactory</classname> or <classname>DefaultFtpsClientFactory</classname> the session is 
	returned from the default session pool maintained by these factories. Session in the session pool might go stale 
	(session that were disconnected by the server due to inactivity) so <classname>DefaultFtpClientFactory</classname> or <classname>DefaultFtpsClientFactory</classname> 
	will perform validation to make sure that they never return stale session to the adapter. If stale session was encountered 
	it will be removed form the pool and the new one will be created.
	<note>
	If you experience connectivity problems and would like to trace session creation as well as see which session are 
	polled you may enable it by setting logger to TRACE level (e.g., log4j.category.org.springframework.integration.file=TRACE)
	</note>
   </para>

	<para>
	Now all you need to do is inject these session factories into your adapters. Obviously the protocol (FTP or FTPS) that an adapter will 
	use depends on the type of session factory that has been injected into the adapter.
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	<note>
  	A more practical way to provide values for <emphasis>FTP/FTPS Session Factories</emphasis> is by using Spring's property 
  	placeholder support (See: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.0.x/spring-framework-reference/html/beans.html#beans-factory-placeholderconfigurer).

  <section id="ftp-inbound">
  	<title>FTP Inbound Channel Adapter</title>
  	<para>
  	The <emphasis>FTP Inbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> is a special listener that will connect to the FTP server and will listen 
  	for the remote directory events (e.g., new file created) at which point it will initiate a file transfer.
  	
  	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter id="ftpInbound"
				channel="ftpChannel" 
				session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
				charset="UTF-8"
				auto-create-local-directory="true"
				delete-remote-files="true"
				filename-pattern="*.txt"
				remote-directory="some/remote/path"
				local-directory=".">
			<int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>]]></programlisting>

	As you can see from the configuration above you can configure an <emphasis>FTP Inbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> via the <code>inbound-channel-adapter</code> 
	element while also providing values for various attributes such as <code>local-directory</code>, <code>filename-pattern</code> 
	(which is based on simple pattern matching, not regular expressions), and of course the reference to a <code>session-factory</code>.
	</para>
  	<para>
	Some times file filtering based on the simple pattern specified via <code>filename-pattern</code> attribute might not be 
	sufficient. If this is the case, you can use the <code>filename-regex</code> attribute to specify a Regular Expression 
	(e.g. <code>filename-regex=".*\.test$"</code>). And of course if you need complete control you can use <code>filter</code> 
	attribute and provide a reference to any custom implementation of the 
	<classname>org.springframework.integration.file.filters.FileListFilter</classname>, a strategy interface for filtering a 
	list of files.
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	Please refer to the schema for more details on these attributes. 
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	It is also important to understand that the <emphasis>FTP Inbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> is a <emphasis>Polling Consumer</emphasis> and 
  	therefore you must configure a poller (either via a global default or a local sub-element).
    Once a file has been transferred, a Message with a <classname>java.io.File</classname> as its payload will be generated and sent to the channel 
    identified by the <code>channel</code> attribute.
  	</para>
  	<para>
  		<emphasis>More on File Filtering and Large Files</emphasis>
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	Some times the file that just appeared in the monitored (remote) directory is not complete. Typically such a file 
  	will be written with  temporary extension (e.g., foo.txt.writing) and then renamed after the writing process finished.
  	As a user in most cases you are only interested in files that are complete and would like to filter only files that are complete. 
  	To handle these scenarios you can use the filtering support provided by the <code>filename-pattern</code>, <code>filename-regex</code>
  	and <code>filter</code> attributes. Here is an example that uses a custom Filter implementation.
	
	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter 
			channel="ftpChannel" 
			session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
			filter="customFilter"
			local-directory="file:/my_transfers">
			remote-directory="some/remote/path"
	<int:poller fixed-rate="1000"/>
</int-ftp:inbound-channel-adapter>
	
<bean id="customFilter" class="org.example.CustomFilter"/>
]]></programlisting>
  	</para>
  	<para>
  		<emphasis>Poller configuration notes for FTP Inbound adapter</emphasis>
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	The job of protocol specific adapters such as FTP  consists of two tasks. 
	<emphasis>1) Communicate with remote server and transfer file from the remote directory to the local directory</emphasis>
	<emphasis>2) Generate Message with the transferred file as a payload and send it to a channel identified via 'channel' attribute.</emphasis>

	That is why they called 'channel-adapters' not just 'adapters' and  therefore the main job of such adapter is to generate a 
	Message which essentially makes the second part of the above explanation to take precedence in such way that 
	*IF* your local directory already has a file(s) it will first generate Messages from these files and *ONLY* 
	when all files have been processed it will initiate the remote communication to get more files.

	So when configuring a trigger on the poller you might want to pay an extra attention to <code>max-messages-per-poll</code> 
	attribute which has a default value of 1 for all <classname>SourcePollingChannelAdapter</classname> instances (e.g., FTP). 
	This means that as soon as one file is processed it will wait for the next execution time which is dependent on your 
	trigger configuration, so if you happened to have a file(s) sitting in the <code>local-directory</code> it would process 
	those files before it would initiate communication with remote FTP server and if the <code>max-messages-per-poll</code> 
	was set to 1 (default) then it would be processing one file at the time with intervals defined by your trigger 
	essentially working as <emphasis>one-poll = one-file</emphasis>.
  	</para>
  	<para>
  	For typical use cases you most likely want the oposite behavior and that is to process all the files you can for each 
  	poll and only then wait for the next poll. If that is the case it is recommended to set <code>max-messages-per-poll</code> to -1 
  	value which means on each poll the adapter will attempt to generate as many messages as it possibly can meaning it will process 
  	everything in the local directory, then it will connect to the remote directory transferring everything that is available 
  	there and processing them locally. Only then the poll will stop and wait for the next execution time

	You can also set it to some value greater then 1 (e.g., 10 which means on each poll attempt to process no more then 10 files)

  <section id="ftp-outbound">
  	<title>FTP Outbound Channel Adapter</title>
  	
  	<para>
  	The <emphasis>FTP Outbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> relies upon a <classname>MessageHandler</classname> implementation that will connect to the 
  	FTP server and initiate an FTP transfer for every file it receives in the payload of incoming Messages. It also supports several 
  	representations of the <emphasis>File</emphasis> so you are not limited only to java.io.File typed payloads.
    The <emphasis>FTP Outbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> 
  	supports the following payloads: 1) <classname>java.io.File</classname> - the actual file object; 
  	2) <classname>byte[]</classname> - a byte array that represents the file contents; and 3) <classname>java.lang.String</classname> - 
  	text that represents the file contents.
  	
  	<programlisting language="xml"><![CDATA[<int-ftp:outbound-channel-adapter id="ftpOutbound"
				channel="ftpChannel" 
				session-factory="ftpSessionFactory"
				charset="UTF-8"
				filename-generator="fileNameGenerator"/>]]></programlisting>	

	As you can see from the configuration above you can configure an <emphasis>FTP Outbound Channel Adapter</emphasis> via the
	<code>outbound-channel-adapter</code> element while also providing values for various attributes such as <code>filename-generator</code> 
	(an implementation of the <classname>org.springframework.integration.file.FileNameGenerator</classname> strategy interface),
	a reference to a <code>client-factory</code>, as well as other attributes. Please refer to the schema for more details on
    the available attributes.
	 <note>
	 By default Spring Integration will use <classname>org.springframework.integration.file.DefaultFileNameGenerator</classname> if none is specified.
	 <classname>DefaultFileNameGenerator</classname> will determine the file name based on the value of the <code>file_name</code> header (if it exists)
     in the MessageHeaders, or if the payload of the Message is already a <classname>java.io.File</classname>, then it will use the original name of that file.
	 </note>
  	</para>
  	
  	<para>
  	<important>
  	Defining certain values (e.g., remote-directory) might be platform/ftp server dependent. For example as it 
  	was reported on this forum http://forum.springsource.org/showthread.php?p=333478&amp;posted=1#post333478 on some 
  	platforms you must add slash to the end of the directory definition (e.g., remote-directory="/foo/bar/" 
  	instead of remote-directory="/foo/bar")
