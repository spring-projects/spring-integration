  <title>JMX Support</title>

  <para>Spring Integration provides Channel Adapters for receiving and
  publishing JMX Notifications. There is also an inbound Channel Adapter for
  polling JMX MBean attribute values, and an outbound Channel Adapter for
  invoking JMX MBean operations.</para>

  <section id="jmx-notification-listening-channel-adapter">
    <title>Notification Listening Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The Notification-listening Channel Adapter requires a JMX ObjectName
    for the MBean that publishes Notifications to which this listener should
    be registered. A very simple configuration might look like this:
    <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:notification-listening-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                   channel="channel"
                   object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"/&gt;</programlisting>
    <tip> The <emphasis>notification-listening-channel-adapter</emphasis>
    registers with an MBeanServer at startup, and the default bean name is
    "mbeanServer" which happens to be the same bean name generated when using
    Spring's &lt;context:mbean-server/&gt; element. If you need to use a
    different name be sure to include the "mbean-server" attribute. </tip> The
    adapter can also accept a reference to a NotificationFilter and a
    "handback" Object to provide some context that is passed back with each
    Notification. Both of those attributes are optional. Extending the above
    example to include those attributes as well as an explicit MBeanServer
    bean name would produce the following: <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:notification-listening-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                   channel="channel"
                   mbean-server="someServer"
                   object-name="example.domain:name=somePublisher"
                   notification-filter="notificationFilter"
                   handback="myHandback"/&gt;</programlisting> Since the
    notification-listening adapter is registered with the MBeanServer
    directly, it is event-driven and does not require any poller
    configuration.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-notification-publishing-channel-adapter">
    <title>Notification Publishing Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The Notification-publishing Channel Adapter is relatively simple. It
    only requires a JMX ObjectName in its configuration as shown below.
    <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;context:mbean:export/&gt;

 &lt;int-jmx:notification-publishing-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                              channel="channel"
                              object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"/&gt;</programlisting>
    It does also require that an MBeanExporter be present in the context. That
    is why the &lt;context:mbean-export/&gt; element is shown above as
    well.</para>

    <para>When Messages are sent to the channel for this adapter, the
    Notification is created from the Message content. If the payload is a
    String it will be passed as the "message" text for the Notification. Any
    other payload type will be passed as the "userData" of the
    Notification.</para>

    <para>JMX Notifications also have a "type", and it should be a
    dot-delimited String. There are two ways to provide the type. Precedence
    will always be given to a Message header value associated with the
    JmxHeaders.NOTIFICATION_TYPE key. On the other hand, you can rely on a
    fallback "default-notification-type" attribute provided in the
    configuration. <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;context:mbean:export/&gt;

 &lt;int-jmx:notification-publishing-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                              channel="channel"
                              object-name="example.domain:name=publisher"
                              default-notification-type="some.default.type"/&gt;</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-attribute-polling-channel-adapter">
    <title>Attribute Polling Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The attribute polling adapter is useful when you have a requirement
    to periodically check on some value that is available through an MBean as
    a managed attribute. The poller can be configured in the same way as any
    other polling adapter in Spring Integration (or it's possible to rely on
    the default poller). The "object-name" and "attribute-name" are required.
    An MBeanServer reference is also required, but it will automatically check
    for a bean named "mbeanServer" by default just like the
    notification-listening-channel-adapter described above. <programlisting
    language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:attribute-polling-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                channel="channel"
                object-name="example.domain:name=someService"
                attribute-name="InvocationCount"&gt;
     &lt;int:poller max-messages-per-poll="1" fixed-rate="5000"/&gt;
 &lt;/int-jmx:attribute-polling-channel-adapter&gt;</programlisting></para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-operation-invoking-channel-adapter">
    <title>Operation Invoking Channel Adapter</title>

    <para>The <emphasis>operation-invoking-channel-adapter</emphasis> enables
    Message-driven invocation of any managed operation exposed by an MBean.
    Each invocation requires the operation name to be invoked and the
    ObjectName of the target MBean. Both of these must be explicitly provided
    via adapter configuration: <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:operation-invoking-channel-adapter id="adapter"
                object-name="example.domain:name=TestBean"
                operation-name="ping"/&gt;</programlisting> Then the adapter
    only needs to be able to discover the "mbeanServer" bean. If a different
    bean name is required, then provide the "mbean-server" attribute with a
    reference.</para>

    <para>The payload of the Message will be mapped to the parameters of the
    operation, if any. A Map-typed payload with String keys is treated as
    name/value pairs whereas a List or array would be passed as a simple
    argument list (with no explicit parameter names). If the operation
    requires a single parameter value, then the payload can represent that
    single value, and if the operation requires no parameters, then the
    payload would be ignored.</para>

    <para>If you want to expose a channel for a single common operation to be
    invoked by Messages that need not contain headers, then that option works
    well.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-operation-invoking-outbound-gateway">
    <title>Operation Invoking outbound Gateway</title>

    <para>Similar to <emphasis>operation-invoking-channel-adapter</emphasis>
    Spring Integration also provides
    <emphasis>operation-invoking-outbound-gateway</emphasis> which could be
    used when dealing with non-void operations and return value is required.
    Such return value will be sent as message payload to the 'reply-channel'
    specified by this Gateway. <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:operation-invoking-outbound-gateway request-channel="requestChannel"
   reply-channel="replyChannel"
   object-name="org.springframework.integration.jmx.config:type=TestBean,name=testBeanGateway"
   operation-name="testWithReturn"/&gt;</programlisting> Another way of
    provideing the 'reply-channel' is by setting
    <interfacename>MessageHeaders.REPLY_CHANNEL</interfacename> Message
    Header</para>
  </section>

  <section id="jmx-mbean-exporter">
    <title>MBean Exporter</title>

    <para>Spring Integration components themselves may be exposed as MBeans
    when the <classname>IntegrationMBeanExporter</classname> is configured. To
    create an instance of the <classname>IntegrationMBeanExporter</classname>,
    define a bean and provide a reference to an MBeanServer and a domain name
    (if desired). The domain can be left out in which case the default domain
    is "org.springframework.integration". <programlisting language="xml"> &lt;int-jmx:mbean-exporter default-domain="my.company.domain" server="mbeanServer"/&gt;

 &lt;bean id="mbeanServer" class="org.springframework.jmx.support.MBeanServerFactoryBean"&gt;
     &lt;property name="locateExistingServerIfPossible" value="true"/&gt;
 &lt;/bean&gt;</programlisting> Once the exporter is defined start up your
    application with <screen>-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote 
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=6969
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
    -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false</screen>Then start
    JConsole (free with the JDK), and connect to the local process on
    <literal>localhost:6969</literal> to get a look at the management
    endpoints exposed. (The port and client are just examples to get you
    started quickly, there are other JMX clients available and some offer more
    sophisticated features than JConsole.)</para>

    <para>The MBean exporter is orthogonal to the one provided in Spring core
    - it registers message channels and message handlers, but not itself. You
    can expose the exporter itself, and certain other components in Spring
    Integration, using the standard
    <literal>&lt;context:mbean-export/&gt;</literal> tag. The exporter has a
    couple of useful metrics attached to it, for instance a count of the
    number of active handlers and the number of queued messages (these would
    both be important if you wanted to shutdown the context without losing any
    messages).</para>

    <section id="jmx-mbean-features">
      <title>MBean ObjectNames</title>

      <para>All the MessageChannel, MessageHandler and MessageSource instances

      <para>Message channels report metrics according to their concrete type.

        </tgroup>
      </table>

      <para>A feature of the time-based average estimates is that they decay
      with time if no new measurements arrive. To help interpret the behaviour
      over time, the time (in seconds) since the last measurement is also
      exposed as a metric.</para>

      <para>There are two basic exponential models: decay per measurement
      (appropriate for duration and anything where the number of measurements
      is part of the metric), and decay per time unit (more suitable for rate
      measurements where the time in between measurements is part of the
      metric). Both models depend on the fact that <screen>S(n) = sum(i=0,i=n) w(i) x(i)</screen>
      has a special form when <literal>w(i) = r^i</literal>, with
      <literal>r=constant</literal>: <screen>S(n) = x(n) + r S(n-1)</screen>(so
      you only have to store <literal>S(n-1)</literal>, not the whole series
      <literal>x(i)</literal>, to generate a new metric estimate from the last
      measurement). The algorithms used in the duration metrics use
      <literal>r=exp(-1/M)</literal> with <literal>M=10</literal>. The net
      effect is that the estimate <literal>S(n)</literal> is more heavily
      weighted to recent measurements and is composed roughly of the last
      <literal>M</literal> measurements. So <literal>M</literal> is the
      "window" or lapse rate of the estimate In the case of the vanilla moving
      average, <literal>i</literal> is a counter over the number of
      measurements. In the case of the rate we interpret <literal>i</literal>
      as the elapsed time, or a combination of elapsed time and a counter (so
      the metric estimate contains contributions roughly from the last
      <literal>M</literal> measurements and the last <literal>T</literal>
      seconds).</para>
