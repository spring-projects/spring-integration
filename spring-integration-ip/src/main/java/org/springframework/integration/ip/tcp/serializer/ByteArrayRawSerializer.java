/**
 * A byte array (de)serializer that does nothing with the payload; sends it raw.

 * writing the bytes.
 * <p>
 * Because the socket must be closed to indicate message end, this (de)serializer
 * can only be used by uni-directional (non-collaborating) channel adapters, and
 * not by gateways.
 * <p>
 * Prior to 4.2.2, when using NIO, a timeout caused whatever had been partially
 * received to be emitted as a message.
 * <p>
 * Now, a {@link SocketTimeoutException} is thrown. To revert to the previous
 * behavior, set the {@code treatTimeoutAsEndOfMessage} constructor argument to true.
