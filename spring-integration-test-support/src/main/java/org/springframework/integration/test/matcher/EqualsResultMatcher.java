/**
 * A matcher that evaluates against the result of invoking a function,
 * wrapped by the {@link java.util.function.Supplier}
 *
 * The goal is to defer the computation until the matcher needs to be actually evaluated.
 * Mainly useful in conjunction with retrying matchers such as {@code EventuallyMatcher}
