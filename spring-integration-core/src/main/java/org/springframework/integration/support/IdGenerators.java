	 * Note: after each {@code 2^63} generations, a duplicate {@link UUID}
	 * can be returned in a multi-threaded environment, if a second thread sees the old topBits
	 * before it is incremented by the thread detecting the bottomBits roll over.
	 * The duplicate would be from around the previous rollover and
	 * the chance of such a value still being in the system is exceedingly small.
	 * If your system might be impacted by this situation, you should choose another {@link IdGenerator}.
	 * Also note that there is no persistence, so this generator starts at {0, 1} each time the system
	 * is initialized. Therefore, it is not suitable when persisting messages based on their ID; it should
	 * only be used when the absolute best performance is required and messages are not persisted.
