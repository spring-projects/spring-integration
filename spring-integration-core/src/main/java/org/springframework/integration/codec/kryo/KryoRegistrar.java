 * By default, user defined types are not registered to Kryo.
 * Registration allows a unique ID (small positive integer is ideal) to represent the type
 * in the byte stream. In a distributed environment, all Kryo instances must maintain a
 * consistent registration configuration in order for serialization to function properly.
 * Registrations can result in better performance in demanding situations,
 * but requires some care to maintain. Use this feature only if you really need it.
