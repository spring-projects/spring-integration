/**
 * A utility class for purging {@link Message Messages} from one or more
 * {@link QueueChannel QueueChannels}. Any message that does <em>not</em>
 * match the provided {@link MessageSelector} will be removed from the channel.
 * If no {@link MessageSelector} is provided, then <em>all</em> messages will be
 * cleared from the channel.
 * <p>
 * Note that the {@link #purge()} method operates on a snapshot of the messages
 * within a channel at the time that the method is invoked. It is therefore
 * possible that new messages will arrive on the channel during the purge
 * operation and thus will <em>not</em> be removed. Likewise, messages to be
 * purged may have been removed from the channel while the operation is taking
 * place. Such messages will not be included in the returned list.
