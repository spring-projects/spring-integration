/**
 * This defines the lowest-level strategy of processing a Message and returning
 * some Object (or null). Implementations will be focused on generic concerns,
 * such as invoking a method, running a script, or evaluating an expression.
 * <p>
 * Higher level MessageHandler implementations can delegate to these processors
 * for such functionality, but it is the responsibility of each handler type to
 * add the semantics such as routing, splitting, transforming, etc.
 * <p>
 * In some cases the return value might be a Message itself, but it does not
 * need to be. It is the responsibility of the caller to determine how to treat
 * the return value. That may require creating a Message or even creating
 * multiple Messages from that value.
 * <p>
 * This strategy and its various implementations are considered part of the
 * internal "support" API, intended for use by Spring Integration's various
 * message-handling components. As such, it is subject to change.
 *
 * @param <T> the expected payload type.
