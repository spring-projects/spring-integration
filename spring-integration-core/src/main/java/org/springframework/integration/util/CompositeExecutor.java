/**
 * An {@link Executor} that encapsulates two underlying executors. Used in cases
 * where two distinct operation types are being used where sharing threads could
 * adversely affect the operation of the system. For example, NIO event processing
 * threads being used for other blocking operations (such as assembling messages).
 * If a {@code CallerRunsPolicy} rejected execution policy is used, the NIO event thread
 * might deadlock, and stop processing events.
 * <p>
 * In order to work in such an environment, the secondary executor must <b>not</b>
 * have a {@code CallerRunsPolicy} rejected execution policy.
 * <p>
 * It is generally recommended to use a {@code CallerBlocksPolicy} on both
 * executors.
