/**
 * Annotation to indicate that a method, or all public methods if applied at class-level,
 * should publish Messages.
 * <p>
 * By default, the Message will be constructed from the return value of the method
 * invocation and sent to a channel specified by the {@link #channel()} attribute.
 * However, a combination of both @Payload and @Header annotations can be used to further
 * manage the message structure. See the reference manual for examples.
 * <p>
 * Note: unlike @Gateway, this annotation is used to generate an AOP Advice for an
 * existing service and its method implementation. The message sending is a side effect
 * of the real method invocation and is invoked after the method returns.
 * The advised method(s) are not aware of the messaging interaction.
 * <p>
 * The XML equivalent is {@code <int:publishing-interceptor>}
