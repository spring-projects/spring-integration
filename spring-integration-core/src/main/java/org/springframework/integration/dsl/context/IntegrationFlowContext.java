/**
 * A public API for dynamic (manual) registration of {@link IntegrationFlow}s,
 * not via standard bean registration phase.
 * <p>
 * The bean of this component is provided via framework automatically.
 * A bean name is based on the decapitalized class name.
 * It must be injected to the target service before use.
 * <p>
 * The typical use-case, and, therefore algorithm, is:
 * <ul>
 * <li> create an {@link IntegrationFlow} instance depending of the business logic
 * <li> register that {@link IntegrationFlow} in this {@link IntegrationFlowContext},
 * with optional {@code id} and {@code autoStartup} flag
 * <li> obtain a {@link MessagingTemplate} for that {@link IntegrationFlow}
 * (if it is started from the {@link MessageChannel}) and send (or send-and-receive)
 * messages to the {@link IntegrationFlow}
 * <li> remove the {@link IntegrationFlow} by its {@code id} from this {@link IntegrationFlowContext}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For convenience an associated {@link IntegrationFlowRegistration} is returned after registration.
 * It can be used for access to the target {@link IntegrationFlow} or for manipulation with its lifecycle.
