/**
 * A connection supplier for a {@link PgConnection} to a Postgres database that is
 * to be used for a {@link PostgresChannelMessageTableSubscriber}.
 * <p/>
 * The supplied connection must <b>not</b> be read from a shared connection pool, typically
 * represented by a {@link javax.sql.DataSource}. If a shared connection pool is used, this
 * pool might reclaim a connection that was not closed within a given time frame. This
 * becomes a problem as a {@link PostgresChannelMessageTableSubscriber} requires a dedicated
 * {@link java.sql.Connection} to receive notifications from the Postgres database. This
 * connection needs to remain open over a longer period of time. Typically, a
 * {@link PgConnection} should be created directly via
 * {@link java.sql.Driver#connect(String, Properties)} and a subsequent call
 * to {@link java.sql.Connection#unwrap(Class)}.
